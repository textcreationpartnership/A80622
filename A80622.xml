            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He compiling of the enſuing diſcourſe, and in this familiar ſtyle, was put upon mee by a more then morall ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitable neceſſity. <hi>Paul</hi> acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth there is a conſtraining power in the love of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. And ſurely the love which through Chriſt I bare to ſome gracious Saints in <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> (now with Chriſt) conſtrained mee to reſerve a tender affection to their ſurviving children. One of them being formerly well affected to the wayes of Chriſt, and accordingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected of the godly where he lived, Hee comming over into theſe parts, was received into fellowſhip in a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Church, and well approved. But falling into ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with ſome who ſtood aloofe to the Baptiſme of Children, and receiving ſome Bookes from them againſt the ſame, He withheld his child from Baptiſme (as others had done theirs) to the offence both of the Lord, and the Church, whereof he was a member. The Elders of that Church tooke much paines with him to convince him of the error of his way: and I ſuppoſe ſome
<pb facs="tcp:113833:3"/> of their learned and elaborate diſcourſes are ſent over by this Ship, for more publike ſatisfaction. Withall they adviſed him to conferre with other friends, and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in other Churches. To mee therefore he came, and acquainting me with ſome of his Scruples, I thought what I ſaid to him, might have ſatisfied; and ſo it ſeemed to me, it did for the preſent. But he told me, other ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples he had, which were all compriſed in a printed booke: the Author I forbeare to name: but he was then reputed one of the chiefeſt note of that way, for moderation and freedome, from the leaven of other corrupt opinions, which are wont to accompany the denyall of Infants Baptiſme. Since then other Bookes have beene publiſhed, of the ſame argument, but with more learning and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter method. But this Booke which hee brought me, containing all his ſcruples, he deſired, that it might bee anſwered, and he ſhould ſo reſt ſatisfied. I was then full of other buſineſſe, and could not poſſibly (though I much deſired it) gratifie his deſire. In this ſtrait, a young Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, (but of pregnant gifts and parts) Mr. <hi>Benjamin Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> dwelling then in my houſe, ſeeing me ſolicitous for the young man, undertooke the anſwer of the Booke: which God helped him ſpeedily and acutely to perform. But the young man tooke not that ſatisfaction from it he well might have done: but excuſed himſelf, it was ſo full of Scholarſhip and termes of Art, that he could not well underſtand it, and ſo could not ſatisfie his conſcience with it.</p>
            <p>Whereupon I was forced, either to ſuffer an hopefull Sonne of gracious Parents (and my deare friends) to fall and lye under that burden, or elſe I muſt Anſwer the booke my ſelf, and that in ſuch a familiar language, as
<pb facs="tcp:113833:3"/> might beſt ſuite with his capacity. Which by the helpe of Chriſt having done, other friends peruſing it, preſſed mee to give way to let it paſſe to more publike uſe of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as well as of him. I was very loth to hearken to them, the Booke (whereto I give anſwer) being ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>methodicall and confuſed, and my ſelf being forced to follow him in like confuſion, that the young man might not complaine (as he did before) of too much Art or of Omiſſion of Anſwer to any thing materiall in his Booke.</p>
            <p>Thus have you a ſhort and plaine account of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent labour of Love. You will receive I hope by other hands from hence, more Elaborate Anſwers to more Elaborate diſcourſes in the ſame and other Arguments.</p>
            <p>Now the God of Truth and Peace accompany all the Labours of his Servants (which beare witneſſe to his Truth) with a Spirit of Power to caſt downe all falſe Imaginations, and to bring into captivity every thought to the obedience of Chriſt Ieſus.</p>

And ſo withall an injury unto the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> of Infants having right therunto, in thoſe whom Chriſt
<pb facs="tcp:113833:4"/> hath made Adminiſtrators of theſe his Myſteries. Great alſo is the moment thereof to the <hi>Conſciences</hi> of many good ſoules, as in the conſequents of the contrary Opinion of denying Infants Baptiſme, is in ſome (I muſt not ſay of all) too apparent. The vindication therefore of this great Truth, doth deſerve and challenge the choiceſt abilities of the Divines of this age: it being in the dayes of this ſecond Reformation with us, afreſh, if not as much controverted, as in the times of the firſt Reformation it was in <hi>Germany.</hi> And it is more light and leſs violence (though in truths taken generally for granted) that muſt end this and all other controverſies of this elevation that are amongſt us. And it will ſurely be rewarded by Chriſt at the latter day, as a worke of more then ordinary Charity, to have pleaded and maintained the right of theſe poore members of his, who want a tongue to ſpeake for themſelves.</p>
            <p>In a manner half the Church of God, and that, <hi>puriſſima pars Eccleſiae,</hi> the pureſt part of it, elect Infants, dye, (as well-nigh halfe the reſt of mankind) in their bud and infancy, and grow not up to partake of the dewes and influence of any other out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Ordinance; and were they deprived of this, ſhould goe out of this world, (into which God onely ſent them to receive that which ſhould make them meet for the common inheritance of the Saints) without any outward owning them, or viſible way of bleſsing from him, that hath bleſſed them and us with his choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt heavenly bleſsings in Chriſt. Yea, and the other half of thoſe that grow up to glorifie God in their riper years, whereof many are alſo holy even from the womb, theſe alſo ſhould during their yeares of nonage want an outward badge, and any outward ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of what they are, even fellow heires of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom with their brethren, which even in the infancy of the world it ſelfe, whilſt all were under Tutors and Governours, was their priviledge. To cleare therefore their evidences, and ſet

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Rother <hi>Silveſter,</hi> I feele your loſſe at my heart, for the love I beare to you, as to your godly Parents before you; I heare God hath lately burnt your houſe over your head, and moſt part of your goods with it. And it troubleth me the more for your ſake, becauſe I feare this hand of God is gone out againſt you, to viſit upon you and your family, your breach of Covenant with the Lord and his People. For though I know that all outward things fall alike to all (the Sheepe and Servants of <hi>Job</hi> were burnt as well as your houſe: and many a godly man hath been ſtruck with ſickneſſe for his tryall, as well as <hi>Moſes</hi> for neglect of an Ordinance) yet whilſt <hi>Moſes</hi> lay under the neglect of an Ordinance, in ſuffering his child to lye by him uncircumciſed,<note place="margin">Silvanus.</note> it had been no raſh judgement in others, nor want of holy wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in himſelfe to think, that God by making a breach upon his health, did viſit upon him his breach of Covenant with the Lord, in delaying and neglecting, (though it may bee for his wives ſake) to bring his child under the Seale of the Covenant. Wee may in brotherly love well conceive, that God hath made this B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:113833:7"/> hee did <hi>Jobs.</hi> But ſurely it will be your wiſeſt and ſafeſt courſe ſo to conſtrue Gods meaning, That your breach of Covenant with God, did kindle a fire in his wrath, which brake forth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your houſe, and burnt up ſo great a part of your Eſtate. For even our God (the God of the New Teſtament) is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming fire, as well to Chriſtians now, as to Jewes of old. And when doth the Iealouſy of God moſt kindle, but againſt the Violation of his Ordinances? which being delivered to us in the 2. Commandement, are ratified by a Sanction from the Iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy of the Lord our God. <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.5. You ſaw, not long before, a like fire of Gods wrath breaking forth in burning the houſes of others of your brethren and neighbours, who had a while before turned aſide into the way ſame of error with your ſelf; which when you tooke no warning by, the ſame fire burſt for that laſt upon your ſelfe. How wiſe and righteous was the hand of the Lord, that when water was neglected to Baptize your child, water ſhould be wanting to quench the fire that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed your houſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Silveſter.</note>I cannot think, that the delay of my childs Baptiſme could kindle that fire, that burnt up my houſe. For (if I know mine owne heart) I was very ready even at that time, to heare Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, and to receive conviction from our Elders and other brethren, if they could ſhew me any errour in this way.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Silvanus.</note>I doubt not your Elders and other brethren have not been wanting to uſe the meanes for your conviction, and ſatisfaction.

But (beſides your owne Elders and brethren) you wanted not other friends (the Eders and brethren of ſome other Chuches) whom you have been wont to conſult withall in leſſe matters, and them you acquainted not with your ſcruples, which whether: it were out of loathneſſe to grieve them, or out of lothneſſe to be removed from your way, I doe not know.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Silveſter.</note>I am not ſo wedded to my way, but I am willing to heare counſell from the word of God: And therefore neither am I unwilling to acquaint your ſelfe with my ſcruples in this point
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:113833:7"/> which I have gathered out of ſome bookes, chiefely out of thoſe which ſeeme to me moſt orthodoxall. For they doe not (as ſome others of that way doe) deny Magiſtrates, nor Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, nor Originall Sinne: Nor doe they maintaine Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will in converſion, nor Apoſtaſie from Grace: but onely deny the lawfull uſe of the Baptiſme of children; becauſe it want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a word both of Commandement and Example from the Scripture.</p>
               <p>It is well that any of that way doe condeſcend ſo farre unto the truth, in theſe controverſies,<note place="margin">Silvanus.</note> which doe ſo nearely concerne the grace of Chriſt and power of Godlineſſe and Publike peace. And I am bound in Chriſtian love to beleeve, that they who yeeld ſo farre, doe it out of conſcience, as following herein the Example of the Apoſtle, who profeſſed of himſelfe, and his followers, We can doe nothing againſt the truth, but for the truth. But yet I beleeve withall, that it is not out of love to the truth, that Satan yeeldeth ſo much to the Truth, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of another ground, and (as his manner is) for a worſe end. He knoweth the times, that now (by the good and ſtrong hand of God) they are ſet upon purity and Reformation. And now to plead againſt the Baptiſme of children upon any of thoſe Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian and Popiſh grounds, which be ſo groſly ungratious, as thoſe above-named, Satan knoweth, and ſeeth they would utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be reject<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d. He chooſeth therefore, rather to play Small Game (as they ſay) then to loſe all. He now relinquiſheth all thoſe groſſe and ungratious tenents, whereby he was wont to plead againſt childrens Baptiſme, and now pleadeth no other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gments in theſe ſtirring times of Reformation then may be urged from a maine Principle of Purity and Reformation, to wit, <q>That no Duty of Gods Worſhip, nor any Ordinance of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is to be adminiſtred in the Church, but ſuch as hath juſt warrant from the word of God.</q> And by urging this Argument againſt the Baptiſme of children, Satan transformeth himſelfe into an Angell of light: and the Spirit of Error and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſſe into a Miniſter of Truth and Righteouſneſſe. And ſo he hopeth to prevaile, either with thoſe men who doe believe the lawfull and holy uſe of childrens Baptiſme to renounce that Principle, and ſo to renounce alſo all Reformation brought in by it: or elſe, (if they ſtick to that Principle) then to renounce the Baptiſme of children: And ſo the Reformation begun, will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:113833:8"/> ſpread farre, nor continue long. For if Godly Parents doe withdraw their children from the Covenant, and from the Seale of the Covenant, they doe make void (as much in as them lyeth) the Covenant both to themſelves, and to their children alſo. And then will the Lord cut off ſuch ſoules from his People. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.14 And ſo the Reformation begun with a Bleſſing, will end in a curſe, and in a cutting Separation either of Parents or of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or of both from the Lord, and his People.</p>
               <p>That place in <hi>Gen.</hi> (17.14) ſpeaketh not of Baptiſme, but of Circumciſion:<note place="margin">Silveſter.</note> Between which though there may be ſome Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance in regard of their common Nature, and uſe, yet this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between them chiefely ſticketh with me, That <hi>Abraham</hi> and his naturall Poſterity had an expreſſe Commandment and word of Inſtitution from God, for the circumciſing of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their Infant ſeed; But the Beleevers of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though they have a Commandment from God to be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized themſelves, yet they have neither Commandment, nor Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample for the Baptiſme of their Infant ſeed.</p>
               <p>It is a Tempting of God, even limiting of the Holy one of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Silvanus.</note> to put upon him to deliver his will onely by Commandment or Example, or not at all; As if God might not deliver his will, by promiſe or threatning, by Proportion, or deduction, by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, as well as by expreſſe Commandment, or Example. What Commandment or Example is their for women to partake of the Lords Supper? yet the Proportion of the Lords Supper with the Paſſeover, and Deduction from ſuch Scriptures as put no difference between male and female, make it to be received as the will and Ordinance of Chriſt, That women able to examine and judge themſelves ſhould partake of the Lords Supper, as well as the men: Every ſhred of Gold hammered, or drawne out of the wedge of Gold, is as well Gold, as the whole lumpe and wedge. Whatſoever is drawn out of the Scripture by juſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence and deduction, is as well the word of God, as that which is an expreſſe Commandment or Example in Scripture. But to helpe you (if the Lord will) over this ſtumbling block (which you ſtick at) the Baptiſme of children is not without a Commandment, and word of Inſtitution from Scripture as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare two or three wayes.</p>

               <p>From whence two Arguments offer themſelves for the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Baptiſme of the children of the faithfull.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument.</hi> 1. Such as be diſciples they are to be Baptized.</p>
               <p>But the children of the Faithfull, they are diſciples; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore children of the Faithfull, they are to be Baptized. The former propoſition is clearly expreſt in the Text, Make diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and baptize them: All Diſciples therefore are to be baptized.</p>
               <p>The latter propoſition, That all the children of the Faithfull (in which is all one, all the children of the Church, for the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:113833:9"/> Church is a Congregation of the faithfull) that they are all of them Diſciples, may appeare by the Teſtimony of the Prophet <hi>Eſay:</hi> who ſpeaking of the times of the Church in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, All thy children (ſaith he) ſhall be taught of God, <hi>Eſay</hi> 54.13. and if they be taught of God, then are they Diſciples, for that is the meaning of the word Diſciples. Diſciples are taught or learnt of God. Doe not put me off with that Evaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; That the Promiſe is made not to the children of the viſible Church, but of the Inviſible: For looke what promiſes are made to the Inviſible Church, they are for their ſakes offered to all the Members of the Viſible Churches, whereof the lively Members are the chiefe.</p>
               <p>By the children in <hi>Eſay</hi> may be meant, not Infants, but men of yeares, unto whom the whole Church may be counted a Mother, and they to her, as children.</p>
               <p>I deny not, but that may be part of the meaning: yet ſo, as not to exclude the Infants, or children of the Faithfull, from the number of the children of the Church. For the ſame Prophet ſpeaking of the ſame Church,<note place="margin">Silveſter.</note> fetcheth in Infants among the bleſſed ones of the Church, and bleſſed with ſuch ſpirituall light, and life from Chriſt, as if they had lived an hundred years in the Church.<note place="margin">Silvanus.</note> 
                  <hi>Eſa.</hi> 65.20. <q>There ſhall be no more (ſaith he) thenceforth an Infant of dayes, nor an old man that hath not filled his dayes. For the child ſhall dye an hundred yeares old, but the ſinner being an hundred yeares old ſhall be accurſed.</q> How ſhall the child dye as at an hundred yeares old, but that he is ſo well inſtructed and inlightned by Chriſt, and thereby as ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of entrance into heavenly glory, as a growen diſciple of an hundred yeares old? The Allegoricall ſenſe which ſome force upon Infants (as if by them were meant young Converts, though of riper yeares) the Text will not beare it. For the Text maketh an expreſſe oppoſition betweene theſe Infants, in the Church, and ſinners of an hundred yeares old. Where the two extreame periods of mans life, old age of an hundred years, &amp; Infants being ſet one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt another, Infants cannot be fitly meant of any but thoſe of feweſt dayes, even Infants of a few dayes, of a yeer or two old. And beſides, the Holy Ghoſt in the Text giveth a Reaſon of this Grace (together with ſome other like favours) unto Infants in the Church above Sinners of an hundred yeares old, taken from the Covenant of their bleſſed Anceſtors <hi>v.</hi> 23: For they are (ſaith he)
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:113833:9"/> the ſeed of the bleſſed of the Lord, and their off-ſpring with them. And evident it is, that the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> reckoneth Infants of the Church for Diſciples. For in <hi>Acts</hi> 15.10. reproving the way of falſe Teachers who would have put Circumciſion upon the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Churches, and their ſeed, Why tempt ye God, ſaith he, to put a yoake upon the neck of the Diſciples? If the Infants of the Church had not been Diſciples, the falſe Apoſtles could have pretended no power to have put that Ordinance upon them. And <hi>Peter</hi> rejecteth it, not becauſe Infants were no Diſciples, but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging them to be Diſciples as well as their Fathers, the yoake of Circumſion was now too heavy for them, as drawing upon them the yoake of the Ceremoniall Law. It is to the ſame purpoſe that Chriſt ſpeaketh of ſuch little Children,<note place="margin">Silveſter.</note> 
                  <hi>Mark</hi> 10.14. <hi>Luke</hi> 18.16, 17. Of ſuch (ſaith he) is the Kingdome of God; which argueth, that even little Children are the members of the Church (which is the Kingdome of Grace) here,<note place="margin">Silvanus.</note> and heires of the Kingdome of Glory hereafter: and therefore Diſciples, for to whom Chriſt is a King, he is alſo a Prophet.</p>
               <p>Chriſt doth not ſay, that of Infants is the Kingdome of God, but of ſuch (as Infants be:) that is, of ſuch ſimple ones, ſo free from pride and malice.</p>
               <p>Then he might as well have ſaid, Suffer Doves and Lambs to come unto me: for of ſuch (ſuch ſimple and harmeleſſe ones) is the Kingdome of God. But that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hriſt ſpeaketh of little children (as ſuch) may appeare further from the Text? In that he ſaith, Whoſoever ſhall not receive the Kingdome of God, as a little child (to wit as a little child receiveth it, for ſo much the Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar conſtruction requireth) he ſhall in no wiſe enter therein. Now it cannot be ſaid of Doves and Lambs, Whoſoever receiveth not the Kingdome of God, as a Dove or a Lambe receiveth it, he ſhall in no wiſe enter into it. 2. Wherefore ſhould Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand little children to be brought unto him, and be ſo angry with his Diſciples for rebuking them that brought them, if they were not at all capable of ſpirituall fellowſhip with Chriſt in his Kingdom, but onely ſerved to fetch a Similitude from their Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and Innocency? Did he ever ſay, Suffer Doves and Lambes to come unto me: for of ſuch is the Kingdome of God? 3. Why doth Chriſt put it for all one, for little children to come to him, and to be brought to him (as he doth <hi>Luke</hi> 18.15, 16.) but that he accepted the Act of Prents in bringing their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:113833:10"/> to him, as all one with ther Act of children in comming them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Chriſt Jeſus? for Chiſt ſaith, Suffer little Children to come to me: and yet they came not to him but as their Parents brought them. 4. Chriſt his Impoſition of hands upon them argueth their conſecration unto God, not as Sacrifices of Bulls and Goates to be ſlaine, (which was one uſe of laying on of hands <hi>Levit.</hi> 1.4.) nor to ordaine them unto office, (which was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſe) but as partakers of ſpirituall bleſſings, and of Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into the family of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which was another uſe of laying on of hands. <hi>Gen.</hi> 48.5. with 14. So that let all this Teſtimony of Chriſt concerning little Children and his carriage towards them be well weighed; and it will evidently evince that for which it is alledged. That little children born in the Church, are accounted by Chriſt amongſt thoſe bleſſed ones of Chriſt, of whom his Church and Kingdome conſiſteth: And ſo are taught of God, as the Diſciples of Chriſt: And therefore are commanded of Chriſt to be baptized with their beleeving Parents.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Silver.</note>
                  <q>The bleſſing of Chriſt upon theſe infants was for bodily cures, as is manifeſt by the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſires of thoſe that brought them to Chriſt, which was not that he ſhould baptize them, but that he would touch them and lay his hands upon them, and pray, as <hi>Mar.</hi> 5.23. <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.13.15. This was the ordinary way of healing in the time of the Law, by ſuch as were inabled by God thereunto, as is cleare by theſe Scriptures compar'd together, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5.11. with <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.13. <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.3. <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.18. <hi>Luke</hi> 4.38.40. Never were any ſo brought to Chriſt but for ſome cure, and for his bleſſing of them, which was in reſpect of that temporall Mercy he beſtowed upon them, according to that they came to him for: and to ſhew his Bounty and Humility, that he was no reſpecter of Perſons; as ſuch might ſeeme to be, that ſuffered others to come, and would have kept back children: And for ſuch to belong to the Kingdome as thoſe children did, and therefore they ought to come, as well as any others. For they were children of the Jewes, and at that time Members of that Church, and ſo of that Kingdome, and had as much Intereſt in Chriſt for outward bleſſings as any elſe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>And further Chriſt is pleaſed to make uſe of childrens Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Innocency to reprove the high-mindedneſſe of his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, &amp; to draw them forth a patterne from the ſame, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.1, 2, 3. with <hi>Mark.</hi> 10.5. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.20. ſo that all this maketh
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:113833:10"/> nothing for the Baptizing of Infants they being not brought to Chriſt for Baptiſme.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Neither doe I alledge this place for to prove that Chriſt baptized theſe Infants.<note place="margin">Silvanus.</note> For it doth not appeare that their fathers who brought them, were baptized themſelves: and therefore neither might their children be baptized according to rule. But I alledge the place to prove that the Infants of beleevers are amongſt the bleſſed ones of Chriſt, ſuch of whom his Church and Kingdome conſiſteth: and ſo come under the fellowſhip of his Diſciples whom Chriſt commandeth to be baptized; neither will your exception againſt this prevaile. Your exceptions, or rather evaſions are two: <q>You ſay that Chriſt his laying hands on theſe children, was onely to reach forth ſome bodily cure to them, it being the ordinary way of healing in the time of the Law.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Whereto I anſwer, 1. You bring not one Scripture to prove, that healing of diſeaſes in the time of the Law was wont to be wrought by laying on of hands, but onely one: which ſpeaketh of <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian,</hi> who had ſuch a miſconceit that the Prophet would have ſo healed him, but was therein foully miſtaken. All the other places alledged by you do ſhew, that Chriſt was wont ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to heale diſeaſes by laying on his hands. And ſo indeed he did, as did alſo his Diſciples after him, by gift from him. But why you ſhould make this an ordinary way of healing in the time of the Law, I ſee not how it ſtands with truth.</p>

There is not one word in the Text, nor any circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the place, that maketh any mention, or giveth any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of any bodily diſeaſe, which theſe children were ſubject to; or that their parents come to Chriſt for the healing thereof. And to give that for the meaning of a Text, which neither the words of the Text, nor the circumſtance of the place doth hold forth, is to ſet up an Image in our owne heart, and to bow the Text to our owne Imagination.</p>

It is not credible that if theſe children had come with any diſeaſe about them, or if their Parents had brought them for healing thereof, that the Diſciples would have been ſo inhumane, unnaturall, and barbarous, as to have rebuked them that brought them. The diſeaſes of little children doe affect all men (that have but the bowels of humanity) with as much compaſſion as the diſeaſes of Elder perſons, or rather more. And withall the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples knew that the Lord Jeſus was wont before that time to vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:113833:11"/> to cure the diſeaſes of young children, as well as the diſeaſes of Elder perſons, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.49, 50. <hi>Mar.</hi> 5.41, 42. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they would never have rebuked their Parents, if they had brought them to ſuch an end. <q>But ſay you, Never were any ſo brought to Chriſt, but for ſome cure and for his bleſſing of them: which was in reſpect of that temporall mercy, which they came for, and he beſtowed upon them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>If you meane never were any ſo brought to Chriſt, to wit, in the Armes of their Parents. It is true we never read of any other in the Goſpells, brought to Chriſt in the Armes of their Parents at all, neither for bodily cures, neither for any temporall or ſpirituall bleſſing. But what is that to the purpoſe? that will not argue that theſe Infants were onely brought for bodily Cure. If you meane none were brought at all but for bodily cures, what meane you then by ſo brought? It is true the Palſey man was brought by foure men in a Couch for a bodily cure, <hi>Mark.</hi> 2. but Chriſt bleſſed him not onely with a temprall, but a ſpirituall cure in the pardon of his ſinnes, <hi>Mark.</hi> 2.5. which was more then they came for; why do you therefore deny the like ſpiritual bleſſing the theſe Infants upon this ground, becauſe their Parents come for no more, unleſſe you think, they had no ſinne to be pardoned? But if none were brought to Chriſt for ſpirituall bleſſings beſides theſe Infants, the greater was the Faith of theſe Parents: and the greater was the ſinne of others.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Your ſecond Evaſion is, That theſe Infants being children of the Jewes were at that time members of that Church, and ſo of that Kingdome, And had as much intereſt in Chriſt for outward bleſſings, as any elſe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If that be all, then there were ſome children of the kingdome of Heaven, which had onely Intereſt in Chriſt for out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward bleſſings; and then indeed they had no Intereſt in Chriſt, nor in his kingdome at all.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the Infants of Chriſtian Parents be not the children of the kingdome of Heaven (as well as the infants of the Jewes were) then the incouragement which Chriſt gave to theſe Jewiſh Parents then, will not reach to Chriſtian Parents now, to bring their children to him now, ſo much as for bodily cures. Suffer (ſaith Chriſt) little children to come unto me, to wit, (ſay you) for bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily curer, for of ſuch (ſaith Chriſt) is the kingdome of Heaven. True (ſaith you) ſuch were the children of the Jewes. But then it will follow by your Doctrine, That wee Chriſtians are not
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:113833:11"/> allowed to ſuffer our children to come to Chriſt; no not for bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cures: for of ſuch as our children be, the kingdome of heaven is not.</p>
               <p>A ſecond argument for the Baptiſme of children may be fetched <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> from another word of the ſame Commiſſion given of Chriſt to his Apoſtles. The Commandement is cleare there for the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing of Diſciples. And neither you nor your leaders doubt of it, that therefore believing Parents are to be Baptized. But what if it appeare in Gods account, and in Scripture phraſe, that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents themſelves are not reputed of God to be baptized, if their children remaine unbaptized? Surely in the old Teſtament a man was accounted of God as uncircumciſed himſelfe if his children were uncircumciſed, for ſo it is written in <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.48. that if a man will come and keepe the Paſſeover, all the males in his houſe muſt be circumciſed: and the reaſon given, is, for no uncircumciſed Perſon ſhall eate thereof, which plainly argueth, that a man is uncircumciſed himſelfe, and (as an uncircumciſed perſon) is to be debarred from the Paſſeover, untill all his males be circumciſed. If then our Lords Supper come in the roome of the Paſſeover, and our Baptiſme in the roome of Circumciſion, looke as he that had not circumciſed his males, was accounted as one uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed himſelfe, and ſo to be debarred from the Paſſeover, ſo hee who hath not baptized his children, is accounted of God, as not baptized himſelfe, and ſo to be debarred from the Lords Supper. If therefore you forbid Baptiſme to children, you evacuate the Baptiſme of their Parents, and ſo make the commandment of God, and the Commiſſion of the Apoſtles, and the Baptiſme of believers of none effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>In the Apoſtles Commiſſion, by Diſciples is meant beleevers,<note place="margin">Silveſter.</note> for ſo when the Evangeliſt <hi>Marke</hi> recordeth the ſame Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he rehearſeth it thus, Go (ſaith Chriſt) into all the world and preach the Goſpel unto every creature. He that believeth and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved: he that believeth not ſhall be damned. <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.15, 16. So that unleſſe children were believers, they are not ſubjects capable of Baptiſme: no Faith, no Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme.</q>
               </p>
               <p>If children have no Faith to be baptized,<note place="margin">Silvanus.</note> then have they no Faith to be ſaved. For the words of the Apoſtles commiſſion are as plaine and pregnant for the one as for the other. He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <q>It is very doubtfull to me, neither hath the Scripture revealed it, that ſuch as dye Infants are in a ſtate of ſalvation; for without the hearing of the word no faith, and without faith no ſalvation.</q>

                  <note place="margin">Silvanus.</note>See what uncomfortable and deſperate concluſions theſe ways of error drive men unto; <hi>Jacob</hi> while he was yet in his mothers womb was in a ſtate of election, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11.13. and therefore in a ſtate of ſalvation, though he had dyed then: <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> was filled with the holy Ghoſt from his mothers wombe, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.17. and if he had then dyed, the ſpirit of life which dwelt in him had quickened him to immortality. To what end were the children who dyed Infants in the old Teſtament circumciſed? what did their circumciſion ſeale to them? <hi>Canaan</hi> they did never live to ſee, much leſſe to inherit: if it did not ſeal unto them ſpirituall and ſaving bleſſings, it was to them a ſeale without a thing ſignified; what though children do not receive faith by hearing of the goſpel, as the Nations of the Gentiles do (of whom the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, in the place whereto you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude:) yet as children can ſee the light, and be taken with it, and turn their eyes to it: ſo the Lord can ſhine into the dark hearts of children, and give them faith to ſee his light, and to be taken and affected with it, though they never heard of it by the hearing of the eare.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Silveſter.</note>
                  <q>What the Lord can doe in inlightening Infants, is a ſecret known to himſelf; the Lord can even of ſtones raiſe up children unto <hi>Abraham, Matth.</hi> 3.9. In which ſenſe children may alſo bee ſaid to be capable of the Spirit; <hi>to wit,</hi> as well as ſtones. But if children ſhould be ſaid to be capable of the ſpirit, ſo as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the Spirit in hearing, receiving and beleeving the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits teſtimony, and ſo to be capable of regeneration, faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, this I deny: and to affirm this to be the way to bring perſons to the faith by working ſo upon them by his Spirit in their infancy, argueth ſome ignorance of the true nature and work of graces, as the Goſpel holdeth it forth.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Silvanus.</note>There is a middle way between both theſe two, in which God can and doth convey the ſpirit of grace unto infants: for neither are infants ſo uncapable as ſtones, (for ſtones muſt firſt have a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſoule conveyed into them, before they can be capable of the ſpirit of grace, whereas Infants have a reaſonable ſoul already:)
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:113833:12"/> Neither yet are infants ſo capable of complying (as you call it) with the Spirit, as to heare, beleeve, and repent, yet nevertheleſs, Infants being reaſonable creatures they are alſo capable, though not of apprehending, yet of receiving the holy Ghoſt from their mothers wombe: for even then <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> was filled with him, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.15.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>It is one thing to be filled from the mothers wombe,<note place="margin">Silveſter.</note> with the holy Ghoſt, as <hi>John</hi> was: another thing to believe, <hi>Act.</hi> 6.5. and 4.31. Secondly, all ſuch ſo teſtified of as <hi>John</hi> was, I ſhall acknowledge; but to affirm that what God teſtified of <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt in the wombe, holdeth true of all other infants likewiſe; this indeed were weaker then infancy to affirm it, and groſſer then ignorance to believe it: <hi>Iob</hi> is ſaid to be a guide to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed from his mothers womb, <hi>Iob</hi> 31.18. ſhall it thence be concluded, that in his infancy he was a guide to ſuch? or if he were ſo, muſt it needs follow that all infants are capable guides alſo, becauſe it was ſo ſaid of him?</q>
               </p>
               <p>To be filled with the holy Ghoſt,<note place="margin">Silvanus.</note> doth always imply thus much at leaſt, as to be filled with the gifts of the holy Ghoſt; or if men had received the gifts of the holy Ghoſt before, yet when it is ſaid againe, they were filled with the holy Ghoſt, it implyeth they were filled with a greater and fuller meaſure of thoſe gifts then before. And that is the meaning of thoſe places which you quote out of the Acts; whence it will follow that <hi>Iohn</hi> being filled with the holy Ghoſt from his mothers womb, was therefore filled with the gifts of the holy Ghoſt, as the gift of faith, the gift of wiſdome, and zeale, and patience, &amp;c. Although he was no more able to exerciſe them, or put them forth, then he was able to put forth any act of reaſon, and yet his ſoul wanted not the faculty of reaſon from his Mothers wombe.</p>
               <p>There is no man ſo weak or ignorant as to beleeve or affirm that all infants are in the like ſort filled with the holy Ghoſt, as <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſt was. But yet if you believe or affirm that none elſe were filled or ſanctified with the gifts of the holy Ghoſt but <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſt onely, or that all infants are not alike capable of thoſe gifts, as well as he; I may ſay as Chriſt ſaid in another caſe, You erre, becauſe you know not the Scriptures, nor the power of God. <hi>David</hi> ſaith, as of Chriſt in ſubſtance, ſo of himſelfe in type, Thou didſt make me to hope or truſt at my mothers breaſts, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.9. <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaith in like ſort, The Lord hath called me from the wombe, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 45.1. and

Yea little children are ſo farre forth capable of receiving the holy Ghoſt, or (which is all one) the kingdom of God (for by his Spirit he ſetteth up his kingdom in us) that our Saviour expreſſeth it generally, that whoſoever ſhall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child (to wit, as a little child receiveth it, for ſo the ſyntax carryeth it) he ſhall not enter therein, <hi>Mar.</hi> 10.15. What though it bee ſaid that faith commeth by hearing? ſo it is alſo ſaid, the Spirit commeth by the hearing of faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.2. And yet you ſee as ſome have received the Spirit, that never heard of faith, ſo the ſame h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>As for <hi>Iob,</hi> the place which you quote, <hi>Iob</hi> 31.18. argueth the like of him that hath been ſaid of the former, that <hi>Iob</hi> from his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wombe was indued with an indoles or inbred diſpoſition and affection to pity and ſuccour the fatherleſſe and widow; which d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ubtleſſe was wrought in him by the holy Ghoſt, as all other good gifts be. And all other infants as well as he are capable of the ſame and the like gifts, if the ſpirit of the Lord be pleaſed to work them.</p>

                  <q>I am not againſt any that have faith, but am abſolutely for all that believe, whether infants or others, ſo that their faith appeare by ſuch effects as the word of God approveth of. But whereas ſome ſay, that infants are capable of the Spirit of God, and of the grace of the Covenant, though not wrought in the ſame way, and by the ſame meanes, yet the ſame things, and by ſame Spirit ſo farre as is neceſſary to union with Chriſt, and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification of life thereby (elſe children were not elected, nor ſhould be raiſed up in their bodies to life) I wiſh it may be min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that touching union with Chriſt three things are eſſentiall to the ſame.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <q>1. Gods revealing and tendering of Chriſt, as the al-ſufficient and onely way to life.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <q>2. An heart fitly diſpoſed by faith to apprehend and receive Chriſt ſo tendered.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <q>3. The ſpirit of grace uniting and knitting the heart and Chriſt together.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>And this I underſtand to be that effectuall and ſubſtantiall u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Chriſt to the juſtification of life, which the word of God approveth of. For juſtification to life, ever preſuppoſeth the parties knowledge of the thing beleeved, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:113833:13"/> Now let this be well examined by the rule of truth, and then ſee how capable infants are of union with Chriſt, and juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to life thereby. As for ſome evill conſequences, which ſome (to darken and obſcure the truth) doe ſay, would follow thereupon, that then infants were not erected, nor ſhould then their bodies be raiſed again to life, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>I would firſt enquire of ſuch, whether infants with reference to their nonage, were the ſubjects of Gods election?</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Secondly, if infants ſo conſidered, are capable ſubjects of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? And if not, as I ſuppoſe none will affirme, then why are they any more capable of grace then of glory? The word of God ſheweth, that he hath elected perſons to the meanes, as well as to the end, the meanes being the way unto the end; and that was the adoption of ſonnes, to bee called and juſtified by belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving on Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.4, 5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29, 30. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13, 14. &amp;c. And to return free obedience unto him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; as <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.23, 24. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.6, 12. And for the raiſing of infants, it is the power of God that raiſeth the dead, and not union with Chriſt, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.16. And when any of Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectcan by the Scriptures be ſhewed to dye in their infancy, then it will be granted their bodies are raiſed to life eternall.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>When you ſay, you are not againſt any that have faith,<note place="margin">Silvanus.</note> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther infants or others, ſo that their faith appeare by ſuch effects as the Word approveth.</q> I demand what if their faith appeare not by the effects? is it not enough if it appeare by divine teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony? Chriſt hath ſaid, that of ſuch is the kingdom. And that all that receive his kingdom, muſt receive it as little children doe, as hath been ſhown above; and is not his teſtimony of their faith as good an evidence of their faith, as the effects of their faith can be? As for the 3 things which you would have to bee minded as eſſentiall to union with Chriſt: <q>The firſt of them (the revealing and tendering of Chriſt as the al-ſufficient and only way of life)</q> if you meane the revealing and tendering of him by the Miniſtery of the goſpel, you know the Miniſtery of the goſpel is but an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward inſtrumentall cauſe of faith, and no outward inſtrumentall cauſe is eſſentiall to the effect, whether we ſpeake of naturall or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall effects: certaine it is that the ſpirit of God, who is the principall cauſe of faith, though he be wonted to work it by the Miniſtery of the Word, yet he can alſo work it without the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, or elſe how came the Wiſemen from the Eaſt to ſeeke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:113833:14"/> Chriſt; and to worſhip him by the ſight of a ſtarre? If you ſay that was extraordinary, but you ſpeake of ordinary meanes; that will not ſerve, for that which is eſſentiall to a thing, the thing can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be without it, neither ordinarily, nor extraordinarily; a thing cannot be, and be without his eſſence, or that which is eſſentiall to it. Beſides, Chriſt ſpeaketh of it as no extraordinary thing for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants to receive the kingdom of God; and they cannot receive it without Chriſt, nor without faith in Chriſt; and yet they never received either Chriſt, or faith by their own immediate hearing of the Wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d. And for the ſecond thing which you make eſſentiall to union with Chriſt (an heart fitly diſpoſed by faith to apprehend and apply Chriſt:) Be not unwilling to underſtand that which is the truth:) The heart is fitly diſpoſed by faith to apprehend or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply Chriſt, when faith is begotten in the heart: for by this gift of faith begotten in us, Chriſt apprehendeth us; and by the ſame gift of faith, the heart is fitly diſpoſed to apprehend Chriſt, even in infants, for when faith is wrought in infants, the heart is quickned with ſpirituall life, and made a ſanctified veſſell fit to receive Chriſt; which reception of Chriſt, though it be paſſive, (as Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it, in <hi>Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>p.</hi> 26. <hi>de Vocatione, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Medullae Theologiae</hi>) yet it is all one with regeneration, wherein not infants onely, but all men are paſſive: which gave the Lord Jeſus occaſion to ſay, That whoſoever receiveth not the kingdom of God as a little child, hee can in no wiſe enter into it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.17.</p>
               <p>It is true, in men of years, the Spirit (as you ſpeake) worketh faith by the hearing of the Word, and by revealing and tendering Chriſt as the al-ſufficient and onely way of life. And faith being wrought, apprehendeth and applyeth Chriſt, not onely habitually and paſſively, (as in infants) but actively to the juſtification of life. And in ſuch it is true alſo (which you ſay) there is ever in the party a knowledge of the thing believed. But I will not ſay as you doe, "That faith ever preſuppoſeth the knowledge of the thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, unleſſe you meane habituall knowledge, which is never wanting, no not in infants) where faith is. For knowledge and faith are put one for another, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 5.3.11. <hi>John</hi> 17.3. So that now, take your own word, having examined what you ſay (as you deſire) by the rule of truth, wee have ſeen and found that infants are capable of the holy Ghoſt, and therefore of faith: and being in the faith, and faith in them, they are in Chriſt, and ſo united unto Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. And being in Chriſt, there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:113833:14"/> to them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. And if no condemnation, then ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification belongeth to them. And if union with Chriſt and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by Chriſt belong to them, then were they elected and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated thereto. For none are called to union with Chriſt, nor juſtified, but thoſe whom God hath predeſtinated thereunto, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. <q>When therefore you enquire, whether infants with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to their nonage be the ſubjects of Gods election. And ſecondly, whether infants ſo conſidered bee ſubjects capable of glory?</q> And when you further ſuppoſe, that none will affirme either. Be it known unto you, that as wee firmly believe both, ſo we doubt not confidently to affirme both: both that infants are ſubjects of Gods election, and alſo ſubjects capable of glory. <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> was an elect veſſell in his mothers wombe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11. neither was this his ſingular priviledge but common with him to all the elect of God, who were elect veſſells before the foundation of the world; and therefore ſo too in their mothers wombe: To ſay, and grant (as you ſeem to doe) that though infants be ſubjects of Gods election, yet not with reference to their nonage; it would imply that you hold the election of God hath reference to their foreſeen faith or works, which they grow up unto in riper years: otherwiſe in their nonage (when you hold them uncapable of faith and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience) it ſeemeth you hold them alſo uncapable of election; which is rank and palpable Pelagianiſme and Arminianiſme. But ſeeing election it ſelf is a grace of God, infants being capable of election, are capable of grace. And thereby it commeth to paſſe that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and heavenly glory is as fit to receive them, as they are fit to receive the holy Ghoſt, ſuch is the fruit of election. And if they receive the holy Ghoſt (as hath been ſhewed above) then are they ſubjects equally capable of grace and glory. <q>But (ſay you) if God have elected them unto the end, to wit, unto glory, then he hath elected them alſo unto the meanes and way that leadeth to that end, to calling, to juſtification by believing, and free obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience unto him again.</q>
               </p>
               <p>All this is true; for elect infants if they die in their infancy, are made partakers of the holy Ghoſt, by whom faith is begotten in their hearts, in which they are in Chriſt, and united to him, which is their calling. By the ſame faith dwelling in them they are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; yea, and ſanctified alſo, and ſo their free obedience is fulfilled to that great commandement both of law and Goſpel (which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth

               <p>And as concerning the reſurrection of infants from death to life, which (was argued above) could not be without union with Chriſt. <q>You anſwer, Firſt, it is the power of God that raiſeth the dead, not union with Chriſt.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But the reply is ready, the power of God raiſeth indeed all the dead, yet none from death to life eternall (which is the life meant in the argument) but by virtue of their union with Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.49.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Secondly, you anſwer again, that when any of Gods elect can be ſhewed by the Scriptures, to die in their infancy, then it will bee granted that their bodies are raiſed to life eternall.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Reply, firſt, it ſeemeth then, that till the death of ſome elect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants be ſhewed out of Scripture, it will not be granted by you that their bodies are raiſed to life eternall. So that it appeareth by your Tenent, all the children that dye in their infancy, none of them are elected nor ſaved; an ungracious and uncomfortable doctrine, which hath been refuted above: whereto may be added, that then there is ſome ſort of mankind, to whom the grace and redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Chriſt</hi> never reached. It hath been ſaid by the holy Ghoſt, that Chriſt gave himſelf a ranſome for all, that is, for ſome of all ſorts. But now there is a ſort of mankind found out [even all that die in their infancy, which are many thouſands] for whom Chriſt gave himſelf a ranſome.</p>
               <p>Reply 2. If infants be elect before they be born, and remain e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect whilſt they are living, can they not dye whilſt they are infants, as well as any other of the elect of God of riper yeares?</p>
               <p>Reply 3. What if it could not be ſhewed by the ſcriptures, that any elect of God dyed in their infancy? will it therefore follow that no infants are the elect of God? What if it cannot be proved by Scripture that any elect Queens dyed in their Regency? will it therefore follow, that either no Queens are elected, or if they bee, they cannot die in their Regency?</p>
               <p>Reply 4. It hath been expreſſely ſhewed above from ſcripture that infants have dyed as at an 100 years old, onely becauſe they were as truly ſeaſoned with grace, and as ripe and ready for glory in their infancy, as if they had fulfilled the age of an 100 yeares, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 65.20.</p>
               <p>Reply 5. If none of Gods elect did dye in their infancy, then
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:113833:15"/> all outward things did not fall alike to all, contrary to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.2. death may (by your Tenent) befall (and often doth) to carnall infants, but never to elect infants. And thus elect infants, whilſt infants ſhould be immortall, which is a paradox I ſuppoſe the Church of God never heard of (before now) ſince the world began.</p>
               <p>Reply 6. If none of Gods elect did die in their infancy, then in eaſe any of the faithfull ſhould come to bury any of their children in their infancy (as many doe) they might have cauſe to ſorrow for them, as without hope; for they can have no hope of their ſalvation or reſurrection to life; ſeeing their infants dying in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, were never ſubjects capable of Gods election, and ſo muſt needs dye uncapable of glory. But for Chriſtians to ſorrow for their dead, as others that have no hope, is contrary to the precept of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.13.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>I would not be underſtood ſo to oppoſe infants,<note place="margin">Silveſter.</note> as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude them from ſalvation, but leave all in reſpect of them, as a ſecret thing to the wiſdom and grace of God in Chriſt.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This doth not excuſe your former harſh expreſſion concerning infants, but rather aggravate it with a contradiction to your ſelfe:<note place="margin">Silvanus.</note> for you diſputed againſt it above, as againſt the rule of truth, to ſay, That infants were capable of union with Chriſt, and of juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to life thereby. And ſure if they be not capable of union with Chriſt, how can they bee ſaved without Chriſt? unleſſe you conceive a ſalvation reſerved by the wiſdome and grace of God for infants; which is not onely without the word, but expreſly contrary to the revealed word of God, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.12.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Again, when you ſaid ſoone after, that you ſuppoſed none would affirme, that infants with reference to their nonage, were ſubjects capable of election, nor ſubjects capable of glory, and therefore demanded how they could bee capable of grace, how can you now ſay,</q> you doe not ſo oppoſe infants, as to exclude them from ſalvation? Can they be ſaved, and yet not bee capable ſubjects of glory, nor of grace, nor of union with Chriſt, nor of juſtification unto life?</p>
               <p>
                  <q>God hath proclaimed,<note place="margin">Silveſter.</note> that all are by nature the children of wrath, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. And therefore I cannot believe that any are naturally born in grace, and ſo believers from the wombe, though the oppoſite doctrine teacheth and affirmeth the ſame.</q>

                  <note place="margin">Silvanus.</note>The oppoſite doctrine (if you meane the doctrine of the Baptiſm of infants) teacheth as the Apoſtle doth, that all by nature are the children of wrath, (even beleevers and their ſeed as well as others) neither did I think that any had been ſo ignorant, as to beleeve or teach, and affirm, that any are naturally born in grace, and ſo (that is naturally) are believers from the wombe; I never heard nor read of any ſuch before, nor doe I beleeve it now. All that for ought I know doe hold the Baptiſme of infants, they teach, that by nature all Infants (Chriſt onely excepted) are born in ſin, and children of wrath: and none of them born in grace naturally, but onely by vertue of the Covenant of grace, which is above nature. Neither doe they ſay that all that are born under the Covenant, are borne beleevers (or partakers of faith) from the wombe, but that ſome by the bleſſing and grace of the Covenant are made partakers of faith, and of the holy Ghoſt from the wombe: and that all are capable of the ſame grace from the wombe; yea, and God hath promiſed to worke the ſame ſooner or later, in all the elect children of the Covenant abſolutely: in the reſt according to his Covenant, hee offereth to work the ſame in his owne time, if neither their parents nor themſelves reject or neglect the meanes which the Lord offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth them.

                  <q>The Scripture in <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. being well conſidered, and rightly underſtood, would ſtop mens mouths for ever, from having a word to ſay for the baptizing of infants. This bleſſed commiſſion of Chriſt to his Apoſtles, was chiefly for us Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, ſaying, <hi>All power is given to me both in heaven and earth, Goe ye therefore and teach all Nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghost, &amp;c.</hi> As if Chriſt had ſaid, Goe
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:113833:16"/> now into all Nations, and preach the goſpel freely, as well to one Nation as to another, for the goſpel ſhall not now be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined any more to one place or people, then to another, God is now a God of the Gentiles, as well as of the Jewes; goe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as well to the Gentiles as to the Jewes, even unto all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and there preach the goſpel, and ſo make diſciples by teaching them; and ſuch ſo taught, them baptize in the Name of the Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt, that is, into the true and orderly profeſſion of that which they have been taught and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved. So that here teaching goeth before baptizing, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſeth underſtanding and faith in that which is taught, this being the onely place of Chriſt his inſtituting the order of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme. And further explained, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15, 16. <hi>Goe into all the world, and preach the Goſpel to every creature; He that believeth and is baptized ſhall be ſaved.</hi> So from theſe Scriptures brought to prove the baptizing of infants, it is clearly manifeſt, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are not the ſubjects of baptiſm appointed by Chriſt. For all the externall benefits and priviledges of the goſpel are given onely to externall and viſible faith. And ſo the ſealing and confirming ordinances of Chriſt, doe even preſuppoſe faith in the ſubject to ſeale unto, and to bee confirmed: So here is no ground for the baptizing of infants, but the contrary.</q>
               </p>
               <p>For clearing this Text in <hi>Matthew,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Silvanus.</note> let it be firſt agreed what is the goſpel which the Apoſtles are commanded to preach to all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; then what it is to teach them; and then it will more clearely appeare who are to be baptized. By goſpel is not meant that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe onely recorded by <hi>Mark</hi> 15.16. much leſſe the curſe annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it, He that believeth and is baptized ſhall be ſaved: hee that believeth not ſhall be damned. For the goſpel is glad tydings; nor is the promiſe of ſalvation to believers and baptized perſons, glad tydings, (as the word ſignifieth, as the Apoſtle declareth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.15.) but onely to ſuch as doe believe; otherwiſe to unbeleevers, the curſe lyeth upon them, and they that groane under the want of Chriſt, and of faith to receive him, they may languiſh for want of comfort, if all the goſpel were comprehended in that promiſe. For they will object againſt themſelves, ſalvation is indeed promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to beleevers; but I neither doe believe, nor can believe. Thoſe words therefore in <hi>Marke</hi> are not the ſumme of the goſpel, though part of the goſpell be contained in them. They are indeed a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble motive unto ſuch to whom the goſpel is preached, to urge them
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:113833:17"/> to receive and believe the goſpel: The one taken from the benefit of believing it; He that believeth and is baptized ſhall be ſaved: the other from the danger of unbeliefe, He that believeth not ſhall bee damned. What then is the ſumme of the goſpel which Chriſt commanded his Apoſtles to preach to all Nations? your ſelfe doe truly expreſſe it in generall termes. <q>That God is now a God, not of the Jewes onely, but alſo of the Gentiles.</q> But to ſpeake more particularly and fully, the Goſpel is ſummed up in theſe heads of doctrine.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That God was in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelfe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. by world is meant Jews and Gentiles.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That God hath committed this word of reconciliation to his Ambaſſadors and Miniſters, to perſwade all the Nations of the world to be reconciled unto God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19, 20.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That God hath given the Miniſtration of this goſpel to bee the miniſtration of the Spirit of grace to worke faith, whereby we receive Chriſt, and reconciliation with God through him, and all the gifts of the Spirit from him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.2.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This is another head of the glad tydings of the goſpel, that to whomſoever he giveth faith to receive Chriſt and his goſpel, to them he giveth himſelfe to be a God to them and to their ſeed or houſe.</p>
               <p>For ſo <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> preached the goſpel to the Jaylor, Believe in the Lord Jeſus and thou ſhalt be ſaved, and thine houſe, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.31. And ſo when <hi>Zacheus</hi> was become a child of <hi>Abraham</hi> (to wit, by faith) the Lord Jeſus promiſed ſalvation to him and his houſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.9. And this was the very ſame goſpel which God preached before unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he gave him that Covenant of grace to be a God to him and his ſeed; for this was the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which was before confirmed of God in Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16, 17. And the Covenant confirmed by Chriſt, is no other then the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Chriſt. And this Covenant to a believer and his ſeed, is glad tydings, not onely to the believer touching himſelfe, but touching his ſeed alſo. As it was indeed exceeding glad tydings unto <hi>David,</hi> that God had promiſed not onely mercy to himſelf, (but as if that had been a ſmall thing in Gods ſight) to his houſe alſo for a great while to come, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.19. which though it concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a Kingdome, yet that alſo was a branch of the Covenant of grace, and concerned the ſpirituall kingdom of Chriſt. And ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the promiſe of ſalvation, and of the kingdom of heaven, which
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:113833:17"/> by the Covenant of grace is granted to us, and our children, is a greater bleſſing then the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and maketh us parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the kingdome of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thus have we ſeen what is meant by the goſpel which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were to preach to all Nations: Now what is it to preach this goſpel, (as <hi>Marke</hi> calleth it) or as you tranſlate it out of <hi>Matthew,</hi> To teach all Nations? to preach the goſpel, is ſo to publiſh and apply it in the demonſtration and power of the Spirit, as that diſciples may be made by it, for ſo the word in <hi>Matthews</hi> own lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage expreſſeth it, Go and make diſciples all Nations. Now who are Chriſts diſciples? Diſciples are all one with Scholars; and Chriſts diſciples or Scholars are ſuch as Chriſt taketh into his ſchoole to teach. And they are not onely believers, but their ſeed alſo, whom (according to the tenor of the goſpel opened even now) Chriſt undertaketh to teach, and teach them he doth, taking his own time, from the belly to their old age. Chriſt taught <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> from his mothers wombe, though not by the hearing of the eare, yet by the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.15. He ſanctified <hi>Jeremy</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he came forth of the wombe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 1.5. And was the God of the Pſalmiſt from his mothers belly, and cauſed him to hope when he was upon the breaſts, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.9, 10. Doe not thinke that though God took the pains to teach ſuch little ones in the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, yet now in the dayes of the new Teſtament he will no more teach ſuch petties. The great Doctor of his Church is not aſhamed now, no more then of old, to ſtoop to ſuch meane worke. No verily, Chriſt in the new Teſtament affecteth leſſe ſtate and pompe in all his diſpenſations, then he was wont to uſe in the old Teſtament: He putteth forth as much hidden Majeſty and glory in riding upon an Aſſe, as ever he did by ruling his people by <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> in all his royalty. Hee requireth ſtill little children to bee brought unto him, and knoweth ſtill how to ordaine praiſe to himſelf out of the mouth of babes and ſucklings. And though it be recorded in the old Teſtament, yet it is a prophecy of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of the children of the Church of the new Teſtament: All thy children ſhall bee taught of <hi>God, Eſa.</hi> 54.13. Which hath beene proved above, to be meant not onely of the members of the church of riper yeares, but even of infants: ſo that an argument from this Text in <hi>Matth.</hi> doth eaſily conclude it ſelf into this form.</p>
               <p>All the diſciples of Chriſt are to be baptized.</p>
               <p>Parents that are brought on to heare and believe the goſpel
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:113833:18"/> preached, they and their children are the diſciples of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Therefore they and their children are to be baptized.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>But you ſtraiten and darken the counſell of God and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of Chriſt, when you limit his meaning to ſuch diſciples ſo taught, as to have underſtanding and faith in that which is taught.</q> For though ſuch a deſcription doe agree to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents (who are diſciples and Scholars of a higher forme:) yet when Chriſt receiveth the parents, who receive him by faith, hee receiveth alſo their ſeed even from the leaſt to the greateſt, to bee his diſciples, and all his diſciples to be baptized.</p>
               <p>But that you may ſee you fight againſt God, in ſeeking to thruſt out infants out of Chriſts ſchoole, and out of the number of <hi>Chriſts</hi> diſciples. Obſerve (I pray you) how <hi>God</hi> leaveth you to ſuch a forced miſ-interpretation of the Text, and therein of the very form and eſſence of baptiſme, as utterly overthroweth the nature of it. <q>Make diſciples (ſay you) by teaching them; and ſuch ſo taught them baptize in the name of the Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt; that is, into the true and orderly profeſſion of that which they have been taught and believed. What? is it now come to this paſſe, That to bee baptized into the name of the Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt, is to bee baptized into the true and orderly profeſſion of that which they have been taught and believed?</q> Why, the true and orderly profeſſion of that which we have been taught and believed that is, of our faith, is but a worke of our owne, though wrought in us by <hi>Gods</hi> ſpirit. Faith it ſelfe is but a created gift, and ſo a creature: And the profeſſion of it is but the exerciſe of faith. And are we now come to be baptized in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the name of Creatures? It is eaſily granted, a man by his bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme may be engaged to the performance of this or that duty: but can it be given for the expoſition of the forme of baptiſme, to be baptized into the name of the Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt, that is, into the true and orderly performance of this or that duty? But thus <hi>God</hi> taketh men in their own wilineſſe, whilſt they goe about to ſhoulder out infant from being diſciples unto Chriſt, and ſo from baptiſme, they exclude themſelves from the chiefe benefits of the baptiſm of Chriſt (which is to have God the Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt to be a <hi>God</hi> to themſelves and to their ſeed:) and in ſtead of approving themſelves to be the Diſciples of Chriſt, they take out a wrong leſſon from the words of inſtitution, &amp; turn the glorious name of the bleſſed Trinity into the weake performance
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:113833:18"/> of a Chriſtian duty, and that but an outward duty neither. One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe infants are not able to perform ſuch a duty, they ſhall therefore be debarred from baptiſme into the name of the Father, Son and holy ghoſt, ſeeing Baptiſme into that name, is but into the true and orderly profeſſion of the faith. But the Lord redeeme your ſoule from ſuch guile and falſhood. Let the name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and holy ghoſt be (as Chriſt meaneth it) the Adoption, protection, and government of the Father, Son, and holy ghoſt (as to have the name of one called upon another, is ſo meant in Scripture, <hi>Gen.</hi> 48.16.) And then infants are as capable of that grace, and of ſuch a baptiſme, as their Parents be.</p>
               <p>Doe not put off your ſelf nor me, with this pretence, that here teaching goeth before baptizing, &amp;c. For though the Parents muſt be taught being gentiles and Pagans before they can bee diſciples; yet the children of diſciples are received into the number of Chriſts diſciples by himſelfe, though themſelves underſtand not what is t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ught them by the hearing of the eare. Neither put your ſelfe off with that other pretence; <q>That <hi>Matthews</hi> words are explained by <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15, 16.</q> For though it be true that one of thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces giveth ſome light to the other, yet either you muſt take diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in a larger extent then believers, or elſe you muſt account of the children of believers, as God doth, not as infidels (as the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Pagans be) but as holy and under the promiſe of grace and faith; and ſo as believers in their fathers right, till themſelves renounce it; or elſe you cannot avoid it (though you doe diſclaime it) that if infants be unbeleevers, and ſo cannot be baptized, then as unbelievers they cannot be ſaved. For the Text is expreſſe, <hi>Hee that believeth and is baptized ſhall be ſaved, but he that believeth not ſhall be damned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither yet ſuffer your ſelf to be put off from the truth by that other pretence, <q>That all the externall benefits and priviledges of the goſpel are given only to external and viſible faith: And ſo the ſealing and confirming ordinances of Chriſt ever preſuppoſe faith in the ſubject to ſeale unto, and to be confirmed:</q> For all this, and the baptiſm of infants, may well ſtand together. For the benefit and priviledge of externall baptiſme is not given to infants, but in reſpect of the externall and viſible profeſſion of the faith of their Parents, or of one of them at leaſt. And this ordinance of Chriſt ſealeth and confirmeth the Covenant of grace to the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver (for himſelf and his ſeed) yea to the whole Church of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:113833:19"/> and to their ſeed alſo, when they grow up to underſtand the nature and uſe of it.</p>

               <p>THus then at length having (by the help of Chriſt) cleared this firſt Argument for the baptiſme of infants of believers from the commandement of the Lord Jeſus: let us now (if you pleaſe) proceed to another commandement, a commandement of the holy Ghoſt, with whom <hi>Peter</hi> being filled in the beginning of his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique adminiſtration of the Apoſtolick office, he exhorted the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent Jews, them and theirs, to bee baptized in the name of the Lord Jeſus: <q>His words are thus recorded, <hi>Acts</hi> 2 38, 39. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent ye (ſaith he) and be baptized every one of you in the name of the Lord Jeſus for the remiſſion of ſins, and ye ſhall receive the gift of the holy Ghoſt, for the promiſe is to you and to your children, &amp;c.</q> From whence the argument that theſe words hold forth, ariſeth thus:</p>

                  </gap> children. And ſo much is implyed alſo in the change and different expreſſion and extent of the verbs of command; he doth not ſay, Repent ye, and be baptized, as if he commanded two duties to the ſame perſons, no more to be baptized, but ſuch as doe repent: But repent ye indefinitely, and be baptized every one of you, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally and ſingularly, not onely ye who doe repent, but your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren alſo.</p>
               <p>But the event ſheweth,<note place="margin">Silveſter.</note> that <hi>Peter</hi> intended onely them that did repent to be baptized, and not their children: for ſo it followeth in the Text, <hi>verſe</hi> 41. Then they that gladly received his word were baptized, which ſheweth that none elſe were baptized, but perſons that were grown up to yeares of underſtanding, ſuch as were affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with the word, and received it gladly.</p>
               <p>It is true indeed the Apoſtles forced baptiſme upon none,<note place="margin">Silvanus.</note> but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred it onely to ſuch as gladly received the Word. But thoſe penitent Jews and Proſelytes, who underſtood that promiſe was to them and to their children, they gladly received the whole Word, both the word of promiſe which they received by faith: and the word of commandement, they and their children to bee baptized, which they received by offering themſelves and their children unto baptiſm; in which reſpect it is therefore ſaid, They that gladly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his word were baptized; becauſe both their own baptiſme, and the baptiſme of their children was the immediate fruit of the parents gladſome receiving of the word; the act of the parents in ſuch a caſe is accounted of Chriſt as the act of the children, as in <hi>Mark</hi> 10.13, 14. The act of the parents in bringing their children to Chriſt, is called the act of the children in comming to him, as <hi>Levi</hi> paid tythes in the loynes of <hi>Abraham, (Heb.</hi> 7.9, 10) ſo in like ſort theſe children here gladly received the word in the armes of their parents.</p>
               <p>But the ground of all this argument ſeemeth to me very weake,<note place="margin">Silveſter.</note> for you take that for granted, which to me ſeemeth very uncertain, (if not untrue) that by the children to whom the promiſe is made, ſhould be meant their naturall children, whereas he rather meaneth the children of their faith (ſpirituall children) ſuch as God called to repent as well as themſelves.</p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:113833:20"/>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Silvanus.</note>The children to whom the promiſe was made if they were one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the children of the faith of their parents, that is, as you meane, not the children for whom the parents believe, but their children that believe and repent as well as their parents, then a double ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity would follow.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that whereas in the dayes of the old Teſtament, upon the faith and repentance of the Proſelyte parents, the Covenant and promiſe did belong to them and to their children: now in the dayes of the new Teſtament, the faith and repentance which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth the parents, excludeth their children: For the children of theſe Jews and Proſelytes (who heard the Sermon) were in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God before the Sermon. But now upon hearing this Sermon, and being wrought upon effectually by it unto faith and repentance, though themſelves be received, yet their children are cut off from the Covenant. A ſtrange doctrine, that the faith of the Parents ſhould ſet their children further off from God and his Covenant, then they were before.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to ſay the children to whom the promiſe was made, were meant onely their penitent and beleeving children, would make the Apoſtles argument a vaine and ſuperfluous flouriſh, whereby he encourageth theſe Jews and Proſelytes to repent and beleeve, upon this motive taken from a promiſe made, not onely to themſelves, but to their children. For by this doctrine the promiſe belongeth no more to the children of beleevers, then to the children of Pagans. For even the children of pagans (whilſt their children remain Pagans) have the promiſe belonging to them, as ſoon as themſelves doe repent and believe. And what more have the children of beleevers belonging to them then ſo? Yea, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles argument is made no argument at all, ſo farre as hee urgeth them to repent and believe, by the bleſſing of the promiſe thereby redounding to their children. For whether they repented and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved or no, the promiſe would belong to their children, when the children came themſelves to repent and believe. Otherwiſe if their children repented not, the promiſe would not belong unto them though their parents did repent. Let me adde for confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion an argument or two more; take this then for a third argument, converſion unto faith and repentance, is it ſelfe given by the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, to the children of the Covenant. And therefore the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Covenant, were under the Covenant before their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and ſo before their faith, even by the faith of their parents.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:113833:20"/> For ſo the ſame Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> (in his next Sermon to the Jewes) te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth, <q>Ye are the children of the Covenant (ſaith hee) which God hath made with our fathers, &amp;c. unto you firſt, God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving raiſed up his Son Jeſus, hath ſent him to bleſſe you, in tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning away every one of you from his iniquities, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.25, 26.</q> If Chriſt then be given by the Covenant, and converſion by Chriſt to the children of the Covenant, then the children of the faithfull are not firſt converted, and ſo come under the Covenant, but are firſt under the Covenant, and ſo come to be converted.</p>
               <p>A fourth argument may be taken from the eaſier engraffing of the naturall ſeed of holy Parents, into Chriſt, then of the poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Pagans; which could not be but in reſpect of their intereſt in the Covenant, and the benefit redounding to them from thence. For otherwiſe the Apoſtles reaſoning (<hi>Rom.</hi> 11.24.) will not hold, If thou <hi>(Roman)</hi> wer't cut off the olive tree wilde by nature, and graffed contrary to nature into the good olive tree; how much more ſhall theſe Iſraelites which be the naturall branches, be graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed into their owne olive tree? What reaſon can be given why the Iſraelites ſhould be much more capable of engraffing into Chriſt, then the Roman Pagans were? Surely, not in reſpect of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ingenuity and better indoles (or diſpoſition) of nature, that will be found in the Iſraelites, above what was found in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans: (for by nature all are alike corrupt and averſe from Chriſt, one as another, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.12. &amp; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.3.) but onely in reſpect of Gods greater propenſion to ſhew his ſaving and converting grace to the children of his confederates. And ſo indeed the Apoſtle explaineth himſelf <hi>verſe</hi> 26, 27, 28. There ſhall come (ſaith he) the deliverer out of <hi>Zion,</hi> and turn away ungodlineſſe from <hi>Jacob.</hi> And this is my covenant when I ſhall take away their ſins: As touching the goſpel, they are enemies for your ſakes: but as touching the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, they are beloved for their Fathers ſake.</p>

                     <hi>Acts</hi> 2.39. are not unto your ſeed, but unto your children, wherein there is a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. For by ſeed in Scripture, is often meant a naturall gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, begotten, and born after the fleſh. But by children a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall generation, walking in the ſteps of the faith of ſuch as have gone before them, as <hi>Act.</hi> 3.25. &amp; 13.26.33. and ſo <hi>John</hi> 8.37.39. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.7.8. And ſo the words import as much, which is to you, and to your children, and to all a farre off, even as many as the Lord our God ſhall call;</q> ſo that the promiſe is

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Silvanus.</note>You much miſtake it, if you take it, there is any ſuch difference to be put between ſeed and children: for both of them are taken alike promiſcuouſly. Sometime ſeed is put for the ſpirituall chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and children are put for the carnall ſeed. And ſometimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine the ſeed are put for the carnall children, and children for the ſpirituall ſeed, in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.26. when the Apoſtle ſaith, If you bee Chriſts, then are you <hi>Ahrahams</hi> ſeed, and heires according to the promiſe; there ſeed is put for ſpirituall children. But when hee ſaith, <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> that now is, is in bondage with her children, (<hi>Gal.</hi> 4.25.) there he putteth children for the carnall ſeed: And ſo hee doth alſo even in ſome of thoſe Texts, which your ſelfe alledge to the contrary, as in <hi>Acts.</hi> 3.25. when the Apoſtle ſaith, Ye are the children of the Prophets, and of the Covenant which God made with our fathers, he ſpeaketh of ſuch whom hee exhorteth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and to be converted, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. And therefore yet they were the carnall ſeed. And he ſpeaketh to them to whom he ſaith, Chriſt was ſent to turne every one of them from their iniquities, <hi>verſ.</hi> 26. And therefore he knew no other of them, nor ſpake no otherwiſe to them, then as to men yet in their ſins. And ſo in that other place which you quote out of <hi>Acts</hi> 13.26, 33. the Apoſtle plainely calleth them the children of the ſtock of <hi>Abraham;</hi> who were the naturall ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and whom afterward he calleth deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, <hi>verſ.</hi> 41. And amongſt whom many of them contradicted and blaſphemed his doctrine, <hi>verſe</hi> 45. So that from the word children, it cannot be gathered that in this Text, the Apoſtle meaneth, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren walking in the ſteps of the faith of their fathers.</p>
               <p>No, nor from thoſe other words of the Text, which you ſay im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port ſo much, which ſpeake of the promiſe made to you and your "children, and to all afarre off, even as many as the Lord our God ſhall call; for theſe words doe not import what you ſay, that the promiſe is onely to ſuch as God ſhall call, and to none elſe: as many as the Lord our God ſhall call, is not a limitation of thoſe remote words, you and your children, but of the next words imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately going before, all that are afar off, leſt it ſhould be thought, that the promiſe is to all that are afarre off, that is, to all Pagans, and infidels, he explaineth himſelfe in the words next following, even to as many as the Lord ſhall call from amongſt them. And all they indeed from among the Gentiles, whom the Lord ſhall call, they ſtill partake of the ſame promiſe of grace with the Jews, that
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:113833:21"/> as the promiſe of grace is made to the Jews and their children, ſo is it now to the Gentiles called, and to their children: there is no difference now between Jews and Gentiles, in reſpect of any ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall priviledges or promiſes. The children of the believing Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles are now as holy as the children of the believing Jews, and the promiſes pertaine to both alike.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>But it is not ſaid in the Text,<note place="margin">Silveſter.</note> the Covenant is to you and yours, but the promiſe. Now we know that every promiſe is not a Covenant, there being a large difference between a promiſe and a Covenant. Let it then be well conſidered, what is here meant by the promiſe: and that is Gods ſending of the Meſſias, or the ſeed in whom all the Nations ſhould be bleſſed; and ſo the ſending of a Saviour or a Redeemer unto Iſrael, as theſe Scriptures manifeſt compared together, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 11. 1 <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.5, 6. with <hi>Luke</hi> 1.68.74. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.23. &amp; 3.25, 26. This was perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by Chriſts comming, Firſt, in the fleſh, in which reſpect he came of, and to the Jewes onely by promiſe, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.22. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.5. <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.5, 6. &amp; 15.24. <hi>John</hi> 1.11. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in the preaching of the Goſpel, by which he was held forth as a Saviour to all that by faith laid hold on him. And this way alſo Chriſt was firſt tendered to the Jewes for a Saviour to ſave them from their ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nnes, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.12. And for to be their King, as to ſave them, ſo into whoſe State and government they were to ſubmit; as <hi>Luke</hi> 19.14, 27. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.36. In which ſenſe the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaketh, when he ſaith, the promiſe is to you and to your children, and to all farre and neare, as God ſhall call. That is, the promiſe, or the promiſed Saviour is come, and is now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods promiſe tendered to you by the Goſpel, calling you and your children, and all elſe, where the word of grace ſhall come, to believe and receive him by faith, who is now come to ſave you and all that believe, from their ſinnes, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.25, 26. And therefore it is ſaid, as many as gladly received or believed theſe glad tydings, the ſame was ſealed or confirmed to them by Baptiſme, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41. according to <hi>John</hi> 1.11, 12, 13. By all which it is manifeſt, that the promiſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.39. is meant of the ſending of the Meſſias, or a Saviour to the houſe of Iſrael, to call them to repentance, and to ſave ſuch as believe from their ſinnes, as is cleare alſo by theſe Scriptures, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 59.20. <hi>Act.</hi> 13.23, 26, 32, 38, 39. And thus the promiſe is to you and your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that is, the promiſed Saviour is offered, and offereth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:113833:22"/> freely to ſave you, notwithſtanding your crucifying of him, yet now repent and believe; for his promiſe is upon the ſame, freely to forgive and to ſave you from all your ſins. Thus the promiſe is applyed to faith, which is the way of preaching the goſpel, and not an abſolute concluſion of perſons to bee in the Covenant of grace and life, whether they have faith or not. What is this, but to keep the wicked from leaving his way, by promiſing them life? This God did not in making of his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant at the firſt, nor the Apoſtle by his applying of the ſame, at the laſt.</q>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Silvanus.</note>In this your long anſwer, ſome things are impertinent, ſome things falſe, ſome fraudulent, and ſome confuſed; but one thing onely alledged out of the Context that may ſeeme to the purpoſe, and that alſo miſapplyed. 1. It is impertinent to put a difference betweene the promiſe and the Covenant. As it was before curious to put a difference betweene ſeede and children. For though eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry promiſe be not a Covenant: yet there is no ſuch large differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence (as you ſpeake of) betweene the promiſe of God and his Covenant, but that they are ordinarily put one for another. The Covenant of not drowning the world any more with a floud, was no more then a promiſe: yet it is called a Covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.11. and the Promiſe that God gave to <hi>Abraham</hi> of the inheritance of the world (<hi>Rom.</hi> 4.13.) was by the Covenant, confirmed by the ſacrifices of beaſts, divided aſunder, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.5.9, 10.17. And that which God calleth the promiſes, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. he calleth the Covenant in the next verſe, <hi>verſe,</hi> 17. Beſides, whatſoever differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence there may be betweene the promiſe and the Covenant, it is here pleaded altogether impertinently. For if it were granted you which you plead for (though there be no mention of it in the Text) That by the promiſe is here meant the promiſe of ſending the <hi>Meſſiah:</hi> yet that promiſe is either given by the Covenant of grace, or by the Covenant of workes. If Chriſt be given and ſent by the Covenant of grace, then the promiſe that giveth him is the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace. So that if the promiſe of ſending Chriſt be to them and their children, (as the Text ſpeaketh) then the Covenant in which that promiſe is given, is to them and their children. And ſo indeed the ſame Apoſtle telle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h them in his next Sermon. <hi>Acts</hi> 3.25, 26. Ye are the children of the Prophets, and of the Covenant which God made with our Fathers, &amp;c. Unto you firſt God having raiſed up his ſonne Jeſus ſent him to bleſſe you &amp;c. the promiſe
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:113833:22"/> therefore of ſending Chriſt, was given by Covenant. And then what difference is there betweene promiſe and Covenant, in this caſe?</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is falſe (which you ſay) that Chriſt came onely to the Jewes by promiſe. For though he came to the Jewes, &amp; to the Jewes firſt, and to them by promiſe: yet God gave a more antient pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the comming of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> to our firſt parents, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. And they were then the common ſtock and roote both of Jewes and Gentlies. If <hi>Job</hi> had not a promiſe of Chriſt his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to be his Redeemer, how doth he challenge him to be his Redeemer? I know (ſaith he) that my Redeemer liveth, <hi>Job.</hi> 19.25.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Againe, It is a very truth, which you falſly deny, to wit, an abſolute concluſion (as you call it) of any perſons to be in the Covenant, whether they have faith or not. For what think you of <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> and all other elect infants borne of faithfull parents:</q> may not a man ſay, that all ſuch are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely under the Covenant even before they beleive? yea their very beleiving which in Gods appointed time is given to them, is it not the effect of the grace of the Covenant; and not the cauſe of it?</p>
               <p>It is alſo another falſhood, to ſay, <q>That the concluding it of perſons (meaning of Infants who may want faith) to be in the Covenant of grace and life, doth keepe the wicked from leaving his way, by promiſing him life.</q>
               </p>
               <p>For wee doe not promiſe life to any by the Covenant, unleſſe they be elect. And though they be elect, yet becauſe it is unknown to them, and to us too, till they doe repent and beleive, we tell them they cannot partake in any ſaving benefit of the Covenant till they be regenerate and quickned by the Spirit, as Chriſt told <hi>Nicodemus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>And it is yet another falſhood to ſay, That God did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude abſolutely any in Covenant of grace when he firſt made it, nor that the Apoſtle did ſo apply it at the laſt.</q>
               </p>
               <p>For when God firſt made the Covenant, he did abſolutely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and in him all the Elect ſeede under the Covenant. For it is a branch of the meaning of that promiſe of God, when he firſt made the Covenant, My Covenant (ſaith he) will I eſtabliſh with <hi>Iſaac, Gen.</hi> 17.21. And yet it doth not appeare that <hi>Iſaac</hi> had any faith, much leſſe viſible. And for the Apoſtle his apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:113833:23"/> of the Covenant, or the promiſe (call it whether you will, all is one to me) certain it is, the Apoſtle doth not ſuſpend the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens being in Covenant upon their owne faith, but upon the faith and repentance of their Fathers. Repent (ſaith he, ſpeaking to the fathers) and ſo let every one of you be baptized, &amp;c. For the promiſe is made to you and to your children. Whence the ſcope of the Apoſtles exhortation fitly ariſeth into this argument, and concludeth after this manner; as hath been ſhown above.</p>
               <p>To whom the promiſe is made, they ought to be baptized every one of them.</p>
               <p>But to you repenting, and to your children, the promiſe is made.</p>
               <p>Therefore you and your children ought to be baptized every one of you.</p>
               <p>And beſides, the Apoſtle in his next Sermon ſo expoundeth the Covenant, as given not onely to them that are converted, and ſo brought on to believe: but to them who yet want faith and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion. And therefore he ſaith, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.25, 26. Ye are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Covenant unto whom God having raiſed up his Son Jeſus, hath ſent him to bleſſe you, in converting (or turning away) every one of you from his iniquities. Their being in Covenant (who were the children of the faithfull) was not the fruit of their own turning to God; but their turning to God is held forth by him as a bleſſing and fruit of their being in Covenant.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <q>This is fraudulent, that you hold forth the comming of Chriſt in the goſpel to be for this end, to call upon men to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and believe, and ſubmit themſelves to his State and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</q> Which though it be very true, yet it is like the frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulent practice of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> to pay part of the price, that they might more cunningly conceale the reſt. So you in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, hold forth this end (which is indeed part of Chriſts comming in the goſpel) the more cloſely to conceale another part of it, which is, to give faith and ſalvation to the children of beleevers, and accordingly to call their parents to ſubmit their children and houſholds, as well as themſelves, to the ſtate and government of the Lord Jeſus. For why ſhould Chriſt encourage children to come to him (<hi>Marke</hi> 10.14.) if it were no end of Chriſts comming, to come to ſave them?</p>
               <p n="4">4. <q>Theſe things are very confuſed in your anſwer, that you put it for all one, Chriſt to come to ſave men from their ſins, and to call men to believe.</q>
               </p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:113833:23"/>
               <p>For though theſe follow one another, yet they require a farre different ſtate of the ſubject, unto whom this different grace is ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. For if you ſpeake of ſaving from ſin (or juſtifying) <hi>Christ</hi> juſtifieth or ſaveth none from ſin, but believers, or ſuch at leaſt, as have faith. But when he calleth men to believe or to repent, he commeth to them not as having faith or repentance, but as wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting both. And yet when he commeth to call them unto faith and repentance, he doth it out of reſpect of his Covenant with their Fathers, whoſe children they were: yea, and in this call of them, hee commeth to give them repentance and forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.31. And in giving it to their Fathers, he promiſeth alſo to give the ſame unto their children, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.31.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, there is one thing alledged out of the context, which may ſeeme pertinent to the purpoſe, if it were fitly applyed. You truly alledge that in <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41. <q>It is ſaid, As many as gladly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his word (or as you call it, glad tydings) they were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, or as you ſay, the ſame was ſealed and confirmed unto them by baptiſme. But this will not prove that which you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it for, that therefore it is manifeſt, that by the promiſe (<hi>Acts</hi> 2.39.) is meant the ſending of the Meſſias.</q> For the text will every way as fitly (and more fitly) carry it to be meant of the promiſe of remiſſion of ſins, and of receiving the gift of the holy Ghoſt; ſo the words run directly; <hi>Repent ye</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and bee bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized every one of you in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, for the remiſſion of ſins, and ye ſhall receive the gift of the holy Ghoſt, for the promiſe is to you and to your children:</hi> What promiſe? Here is no promiſe mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but the remiſſion of ſins, and gift of the Holy Ghoſt: And the gift of the Holy Ghoſt is called a promiſe, <hi>verſe</hi> 33. &amp; <hi>Acts</hi> 1.4, 5. But it is not materiall to the purpoſe, whether by the promiſe you underſtand the comming of Chriſt, or the gift of the Holy Ghoſt, or remiſſion of ſinnes purchaſed by the one, and ſealed by the other. For all theſe promiſes are given by one and the ſame Covenant of grace. And if any one of theſe promiſes belonged to them, the whole Covenant of grace belonged to them alſo. But to deale ingenuouſly and faithfully with you, the Text which you quote (out of <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41.) might hold forth a juſt colour of an Objection (if you had ſo applyed it) againſt the argument gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of <hi>verſe</hi> 38, 39. for the baptiſme of infants. For if they who were baptized were ſuch as gladly received his word (<hi>verſe</hi> 41.) then it doth not appeare out of this place, that infants were at that time baptized with the reſt: becauſe they could not receive the word,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:113833:24"/> much leſſe gladly, leaſt of all expreſſe their gladneſſe by any viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble profeſſion. This objection (I confeſſe) would have prevailed with me to have forborn any proof of the Baptiſme of infants out of this place; were it not partly for the Reaſons which have been alledged above (from the words of <hi>verſe</hi> 39.) partly alſo for that I finde, the Lord Jeſus is wont to accept the acts of Parents (in the duties of the ſecond Commandement) as done for themſelves, and for their children, as hath been touched above. For look as when <hi>Levi</hi> is ſaid to pay tythes in <hi>Abraham,</hi> it was becauſe <hi>Abraham</hi> in paying tythes was reputed of God, as paying them for himſelf, and for <hi>Levi, Heb.</hi> 7.9. And as when Parents came and brought their children to Chriſt, their comming was reputed of Chriſt as the comming of their children, as well as of themſelves, <hi>Mar.</hi> 10.14. So when <hi>Peters</hi> hearers received the word gladly, they gladly received in both for themſelves and their children, to wit, both the word of promiſe, which was expreſly given to themſelves and their children: and alſo the word of Commandement (which was grounded upon the promiſe, and urged as farre as the promiſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended) Be baptized every one of you: and thereupon they in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his word gladly, did gladly give up both themſelves and their children to be baptized.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Silveſter.</note>
                  <q>But before you take the baptiſme of infants concluded out of this place, conſider what you will ſay to another interpretation, which I have ſeen made of this place. For there bee that ſay, That by the promiſe to you and to your children, is not meant the Covenant of grace to you and to your children; but the promiſe of ſending the Holy Ghoſt to enable them, and their ſons and daughters to prophecy: Which promiſe <hi>Peter</hi> quoted out of <hi>Joel, Act.</hi> 2.16, 17. which promiſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> received of the Father, and had now ſhed abroad in their ſight and hearing, <hi>verſe</hi> 33. and which <hi>Peter</hi> promiſed to them upon their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and baptiſme, <hi>verſe</hi> 38. becauſe the promiſe was to them and to their children.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Silvanus.</note>Thus ſometimes you will have the promiſe to be underſtood of ſending Chriſt, and ſometime of ſending the holy Ghoſt, but the truth is, both are but effects of the ſame grace, and both given by the ſame Covenant. The Engliſh proverb ſpeaketh of ſuch men as are loath to ſee what they doe ſee, that they cannot ſee the wood for trees: ſo theſe men cannot ſee the Covenant for the promiſes; what is the wood but a ſtorehouſe of trees? and what is the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:113833:24"/> of grace, but the ſtorehouſe of the promiſes of grace? In the Covenant of grace when God giveth himſelfe to bee the God of the faithfull and of their ſeed, the Father promiſeth himſelfe to be their Father, Chriſt promiſeth to be their Redeemer, and the Holy Ghoſt promiſeth to be their ſanctifier. You may as ſoone ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate the perſons in the Trinity from being one God, as ſeparate the gift of one of theſe perſons to us and to our children, from the gifts of the other; or ſeparate all theſe gifts, or the promiſes of theſe gifts from the Covenant of grace.</p>
               <p>But if the gift of the Holy Ghoſt be here promiſed to theſe Iews and Proſelytes and to their children,<note place="margin">Silveſter.</note> that they might ſpeake with new tongues, and prophecy, then in this place by children cannot be meant infants; for infants are not capable of ſpeaking with tongues and prophecying.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Silvanus.</note> though he ſpeake of the promiſe of the gift of the Holy Ghoſt, which in the former part of the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter did enable the Diſciples to ſpeake with new tongues, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy; yet he did not intend to limit and confine the gift of the Holy Ghoſt to that work in theſe Converts here; for that would have been ſmall comfort to them who were pricked in heart, and enquired the way of ſalvation, to put them off with a promiſe of the Holy Ghoſt, to worke ſuch gifts of tongues and prophecying, as were common to hypocrites, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.22, 23. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.1. The Apoſtle therefore who better knew how to ſatisfie and heale theſe wounded ſoules, hee promiſeth to them ſuch a gift of the Holy Ghoſt as is joyned with remiſſion of ſinnes, and accompanyeth ſalvation, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38, 39. And though infants (whilſt infants) are not capable of ſpeaking with tongues, and prophecying, (which is but one gift of the Holy Ghoſt, and but a common gift neither) yet they are capable of the Holy Ghoſt for regeneration and remiſſion of ſins, which are the chief bleſſings of the Covenant, which theſe Converts then ſtood in need of, and for the effectuall working of which, the Apoſtle telleth them, <hi>The promiſe was made to them and to their children;</hi> which indeed cannot bee wrought, but by the gift both of Chriſt, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>And now having ſaid enough (as I conceive) if not too much for the clearing of theſe two firſt Arguments for the Baptiſme of the infants of believers; Let us now proceed to adde a third taken from the Analogy of the Circumciſion of the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the Commandement of God for the ſame.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Silveſter.</note>I have heard much agitation of ſuch an argument (and more of that then of any other) but I am very ſlow to believe the baptiſm of infants upon that ground.</p>

               <p>Hath not the Lord given that Covenant of grace which was then to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed, now to beleevers and our ſeed?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Silveſter.</note>What then?</p>
               <p>

                  <note place="margin">Silveſter.</note>What of all this?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Silvanus.</note>Then out of all theſe it followeth, that if the ſame Covenant of grace be now given to believers and our ſeed, which was given to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed; and if baptiſme be now given to us as a ſeale of the Covenant, in the room of Circumciſion, then the ſame Covenant, which gave a Commandement, or a word of inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the Circumciſion of <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed, giveth the ſame Commandement, or a Word of Inſtitution for the baptiſme of beleevers and our ſeed. As by like proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is juſtly gathered, that if Baptiſme be given us in the roome of Circumciſion, and the Lords Supper in the room of the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, then as no uncircumciſed perſon might eate of the Paſſeover: ſo now no unbaptized perſon may eate of the Lords Supper.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Silveſter.</note>Here are many things preſuppoſed, but not proved: as, firſt, that the Covenant which God made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed, was a Covenant of grace. For ſome ſay it was a Covenant of temporall bleſſings (as of the inheritance of <hi>Canaan</hi>) not ſpirituall. Others ſay, it was a Covenant of works, not of grace. And others ſay, that though it was a Covenant of grace to <hi>Abraham</hi> (and to his faithfull ſeed) yet it was a Covenant of works, at leaſt to his carnall ſeed.</p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:113833:25"/>
               <p>Secondly, it is preſuppoſed, but not proved, that Circumciſion was a ſeale of the Covenant of grace to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſeed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, neither is it proved, that God hath made a Covenant of grace now with Believers and our naturall ſeed.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Neither is it proved, that Baptiſme with water is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us of God in ſtead of circumciſion.</p>
               <p>It is true,<note place="margin">Silvanus.</note> the Devill hath beſtirred himſelfe mightily to call in queſtion all theſe truths of the Covenant of grace; that ſo hee might make the Covenant of none effect both to Parents and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Now the Lord rebuke him, and make us wiſe to diſcern his enterprizes. But to cleare all theſe points, let us (by the help of Chriſt) prove them one and other, as well as preſuppoſe them. We muſt not loſe nor caſt away any Divine truth, becauſe it is que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned, but rather contend for it, and the more earneſtly, becauſe it is oppoſed.</p>
               <p>For the firſt there is a truth in it, though not the whole truth, that the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> was of temporall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, (ſuch as deliverance from <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the inheritance of <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>) but not of temporall bleſſings onely nor chiefly, even as the Covenant of grace with us, though it chiefly convey ſpirituall and eternall mercies, yet it reacheth alſo to temporall bleſſings alſo, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23. Reaſons hereof from the word are plaine and ſtrong. 1. From the Tenor of the Covenant, I will bee a God to thee and to thy ſeed after thee, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. Now God to be a God to us and our ſeed, is more then a temporall bleſſing, even all-ſufficient goodneſſe for us and ours, for our ſoules, and for our bodies, for this life and for ever: God giving himſelfe to be our God, the Father giveth himſelfe to be our Father; God the Son giveth himſelf to be our Redeemer; and God the holy Ghoſt giveth himſelf to be our Sanctifier and Comforter. And indeed, that Chriſt was promiſed and given in this Covenant, is clear from <hi>Luke</hi> 1.54, 55. and <hi>Verſe</hi> 69, 72, 73. The holy Ghoſt alſo is here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed and given in this Covenant as well as Chriſt the Angel of the Covenant, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 63.9, 10, 11.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in the words of this Covenant, God giving himſelfe to be a God to <hi>Abraham</hi> and to his ſeed: hee therein promiſed life to them, yea life after death. For the Covenant was ſo rehearſed by <hi>Moſes,</hi> after the death of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob, Exod.</hi> 3.6. Whence Chriſt undeniably concludeth that God promiſed and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:113833:26"/> gave to them reſurrection from the dead, and eternall life, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.31, 32. <hi>Luke</hi> 20.37.38. Surely reſurrection from death, and living to God after death, are not temporall bleſſings.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Canaan</hi> it ſelfe was not given as a meere temporall bleſſing: but as a pledge of a ſpirituall inheritance, a ſeale of the Church, a type of Heaven.<note place="margin">Gen. 47.21 to 31. and Chap. 50.25. Heb. 11.22.</note> Hence it was that <hi>Jacob</hi> gave ſuch a ſolemne charge by oath unto <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and <hi>Joſeph</hi> to his brethren, the one to bury his dead body in <hi>Canaan,</hi> the other for the tranſportation of his bones to <hi>Canaan:</hi> which they would never have done for an earthly inheritance, but to nouriſh in the hearts of their poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, faith and deſire of their communion in the Church, and of their reſt in heaven, whereof the reſt in <hi>Canaan</hi> was a type, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto not <hi>Moſes,</hi> but <hi>Joſhua</hi> muſt bring them, that is, not the law, but Jeſus, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.11. with Chap. 4, 5.8. And their caſting out of that Country by captivity was their caſting out of Gods ſight. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.28. Whereby their Church Eſtate was diſſolved, the Communion of Saints ſcattered, the Ordinances of his publike Worſhip removed from them, and their hopes of heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Silveſter.</note>But I have read it ſtrongly pleaded, that the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> was an old Covenant, a Covenant of workes, which Chriſt hath therefore diſanulled as old and weake, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.13. Now ſtill to pleade our owne and our childrens right unto that Covenant, and to the Seale thereof, is to confound the Old and New Teſtament, Law and Goſpel; beſides Circumciſion (which was a Signe and Seale of the Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi>) bound them that received it, to keepe the whole Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.3. And therefore the Covenant to which it was annexed was a legall Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, a Covenant of workes, and not of grace.</p>
               <p>The Old Covenant ſpoken of <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.13. was not the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> but with the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> when God brought them out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> as is expreſly ſaid, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.9. which Covenant comming 430. yeares after the Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> is expreſly diſtinguiſhed from it, as that which could not diſanull the promiſe or Covenant, which went before unto <hi>Abraham. Ga.</hi> 3.17.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Silveſter.</note>But why ſhould the Covenant with the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> on Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> be called old, in compariſon of the Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> which was 430 yeares older then it?</p>
               <p>The Covenant made on Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> is not called old in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of the Covenant made <hi>Abraham:</hi> bur in compariſon of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:113833:26"/> the Evangelicall diſpenſation of the Covenant of grace by the Lord Jeſus: in whom the ſacrifices and Leviticall Ceremonies being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed and aboliſhed, we look for atonement not in bloud of Bulls and Goates, nor in Legall Ablutions, but in the bloud of Chriſt onely.</p>
               <p>And as for Circumciſion, though the Apoſtle ſay, that every one circumciſed, is bound to keep the whole Law; yet that doth not argue, that circumciſion was to <hi>Abraham</hi> a ſigne and ſeale of the Covenant of works; for a double anſwer may juſtly be given to it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, they that hold that the Covenant given on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> was the Covenant of works, (as doe <hi>Melancthon, Chemnitius, Piſcator, &amp;c.</hi>) They would anſwer that circumciſion was a ſigne of the Covenant of workes, not as circumciſion was given to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> but as it was given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> for <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo enjoyned cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion as a Leviticall rite, <hi>Lev.</hi> 12.3. But <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth a difference between circumciſion as given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and as of the Fathers, <hi>John</hi> 7.22, 23.</p>
               <p>Secondly, but they that hold the Covenant on Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> to have been a Covenant of grace, but onely vailed under types and ſhadowes, (as doe <hi>Calvin, Bucer, Bucan, &amp;c.</hi>) they would anſwer, that circumciſion did bind to the keeping of the whole Law; not as it was given either to <hi>Abraham,</hi> or to <hi>Moſes,</hi> but as it was urged by the falſe Apoſtles who expected juſtification from the obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it. To ſuch indeed it is truly alledged, that if they looke for juſtification by the obſervation of circumciſion, they are then bound to obſerve the whole Law. For it is not the obſervation of one commandement of the Law, that can juſtifie, but the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the whole Law, for hee that breaketh any one commandement of the Law, is guilty of all, <hi>James</hi> 2.10. Whence it is that <hi>Paul</hi> putteth the obſervation of circumciſion (to wit, in the ſenſe of the falſe Apoſtles) as all one with juſtification by the works of the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.3, 4. And thereby proveth that if the Galatians be circumciſed, Chriſt ſhould profit them nothing, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. they were fallen from grace, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. And yet <hi>Timothy</hi> who received circumciſion, not in the ſenſe of the falſe Apoſtles, as neceſſary to juſtification; but for other reſpect, to avoid offence, hee did not thereby fall from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or loſe his profit in Chriſt Jeſus. But to put it out of doubt that circumciſion given to <hi>Abraham</hi> was a ſigne and ſeale not of the Covenant of works, but of grace, the Apoſtles words are evident, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. <hi>Abraham</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>received the ſigne
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:113833:27"/> of Circumciſion, a ſeale of the righteouſneſſe of faith.</hi> Now righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of faith is not found in the Covenant of works, but in the Covenant of grace onely. The Covenant of works holdeth forth no righteouſneſſe but by the works of the Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Silveſter.</note>
                  <q>I would not deny that the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> was a Covenant of grace to him and to his faithfull ſeed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently Circumciſion was a ſigne and ſeale of the ſame Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace to them; but to the carnall ſeed (ſuch as <hi>Iſmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi>) it was not a Covenant of grace to them: for then as they fell away from that Covenant; ſo they had fallen away from a ſtate of grace, which would too much countenance and cheriſh the Arminian and Popiſh error of Apoſtaſie from grace. Neither could circumciſion be to them a ſigne or ſeale of the Covenant of grace, nor of the righteouſneſſe of faith given in that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, for neither had they faith, nor righteouſneſſe by faith before their circumciſion, as <hi>Abraham</hi> had; nor after their cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, as the elect ſeed had. And how could then God ſet his ſeale to a falſhood?</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Silvanus.</note>What if that were granted you which you ſay (which yet many good Divines will not admit) that the Covenant of God with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> was a Covenant of grace onely to him and to his faithfull ſeed, and to them Circumciſion was a ſeale of the ſame Covenant: but to the carnal ſeed, the Covenant was a Covenant of works, and circumciſion a ſeale of the Covenant of works? Though all this were granted, yet ſtill it remaineth good, that all the ſeed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> (ſpirituall and carnall) were in Covenant with God, one Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant or other, either of works or grace; and were all partakers of the ſeale of the Covenant, to wit, circumciſion, though in a different reſpect. But then it will unavoydably follow, that if the Covenant given to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed be given to beleevers and our ſeed; then as all the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> (whether carnall or ſpirituall) were in Covenant with God, and ſo circumciſed: ſo all the ſeed of believers are in Covenant with God, and ſhould now be baptized. If you ſay, then Baptiſme ſhall be a ſeale of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of works to the carnall ſeed of believers, and that were an abſurdity now in the dayes of the new Teſtament.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> No greater abſurdity then to ſay, that circumciſion was a ſeale of the Covenant of works to the carnall ſeed of <hi>Abraham.</hi> For <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of the two Covenants under which the twofold ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> lay, hee ſaith, <hi>As it was then, ſo is it now:</hi> As
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:113833:27"/> it was then in the old Teſtament, ſo it is now in the New: <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.29. Read from <hi>verſ.</hi> 24. to the end of that chapter. As it was then, ſo is it now; not onely in this reſpect, that he that was borne after the fleſh, perſecuted him that was borne after the ſpirit: But in this alſo, that as then ſome of the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> were born of <hi>Hagar,</hi> that is, born of the Covenant of works, and born after the fleſh: and ſome were born of <hi>Sarah</hi> the free-woman, that is, born of the Covenant of grace, and born after the Spirit; ſo is it now, in the days of the new Teſtament.</p>
               <p>But to give you a further anſwer and ſafer, and more generally accepted; Let me ſhew you, how the carnall ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> might then, and may now partake (after a ſort) in the Covenant of grace, and in the ſeale of the Covenant of grace, and yet fall away from grace: and nevertheleſſe their falling from grace be no countenance to the <hi>Arminian</hi> error of apoſtaſie from grace.</p>
               <p>There is a double ſtate of grace, one adherent, (which ſome not unfitly call federall grace) ſanctifying to the purifying of the fleſh, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.13. another inherent, ſanctifying of the inner man. And of this latter there be two ſorts, one, wherin perſons in Covenant are ſanctified by common graces, which make them ſerviceable and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in their callings, as <hi>Saul, Jehu, Judas,</hi> and <hi>Demas,</hi> and ſuch like hypocrites. Another whereby perſons in Covenant are ſanctified unto union and communion with Chriſt and his members in a way of regeneration and ſalvation. In reſpect of adherent or fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derall grace, all the children of a believing parent are holy, and ſo in an eſtate of grace. In reſpect of inherent common graces, <hi>Saul, Jehu,</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Demas</hi> were ſanctified of God to their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall callings for the ſervice of his people, as Apoſtates may be, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. Now there is no doubt but men may fall away from adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent federall grace, as alſo from inherent common graces; and yet without any prejudice to the perſeverance of ſincere believers, and without any countenance to the <hi>Arminian</hi> error of Apoſtaſie from grace, to wit, from ſuch grace as accompanyeth ſalvation. And as for the circumciſion of <hi>Iſmael</hi> (and ſuch as he) it was a ſign and ſeale of the righteouſneſſe of faith, not of that which hee had received, but of that which God offered to apply to him in the uſe of the meanes of grace in <hi>Abrahams</hi> family; which meanes, as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> having circumciſed him (and ſo having ſet God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſeale and property upon him) was bound to apply to him, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 18.19.) to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:113833:28"/> prepare him for grace. So <hi>Iſmael</hi> being circumciſed, was bound (as he grew up to underſtanding) to yeeld up himſelf in profeſſed ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, both to the Lord and his father, in receiving and following the meanes of grace applyed to him: for God having by Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant offered himſelfe to be a God to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed, the Lord did thereby promiſe to afford both to him and his ſeed, the meanes whereby they might come to enjoy the Lord for their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>od. For he which promiſeth the end, promiſeth alſo the meanes that lead to that end. And <hi>Abraham</hi> for his part accepting the Covenant for himſelfe and his ſeed, and ſo having circumciſed himſelfe and them in token thereof, he had now bound himſelf to traine up and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate all his ſeed in the meanes and wayes of grace, whereby they might come to enjoy that great promiſe of the Covenant, to have the Lord for their God, which alſo <hi>Abraham</hi> was carefull to doe, as the Lord teſtifieth of him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.19.</p>
               <p>Yea, and <hi>Iſmael</hi> himſelfe with the reſt of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed having been received into the Covenant of God, and to the ſeale thereof, he and they all were bound to yeeld up themſelves to the Lord, and to <hi>Abraham,</hi> in attending to the meanes of grace diſpenſed to them in that Covenant, that ſo they might come to enjoy the ſure mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the Covenant, to have the Lord for their God. But now when <hi>Iſmael</hi> rejected the meanes of grace, as he did by mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and as did <hi>Eſau</hi> alſo, (by ſelling the birthright of the Covenant for a meſſe of pottage) now their circumciſion was made uncircumciſion, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh in a like caſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.25. And ſo they did diſcovenant themſelves and their poſterity from the Covenant of grace, and choſe to be (as the bewitched <hi>Galatians</hi> did, <hi>Galat.</hi> 4.21.) under the Covenant of works. <q>It is therefore a groundleſſe and falſe collection, which ſome of your way do make, that becauſe there was in <hi>Abraham</hi> (when God made a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with him) a double ſeed, (the one a ſpirituall ſeed, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a fleſhly ſeed) and accordingly becauſe there were in the Covenant ſome ſpirituall bleſſings, and ſome outward and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall bleſſings: therefore they muſt be thus diſtinguiſhed, that the ſpirituall bleſſings belonged to the ſpirituall ſeed, and the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward bleſſings to his carnall ſeed.</q>
               </p>
               <p>For all the bleſſings were promiſed to all the ſeede in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. To the ſpirituall ſeede, both ſpirituall and outward bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings were promiſed and given effectually: To the carnall ſeede,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:113833:28"/> not carnall bleſſings onely, but ſpirituall alſo were promiſed, and offered: So as that their falling ſhort of the grace of God, was not from the defect of the Covenant, but from their prophane refuſall of it, and of the meanes of grace offered in it. For it is an evident and confeſſed Truth, and the Text is cleare for it, That in the Covenant, God offered himſelfe to be a God to all the ſeede. Now God is not an outward or carnall bleſſing: but as himſelfe is a Spirit, ſo is he alſo a ſpirituall bleſſing to whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he is diſpenſed.</p>
               <p>Well then,<note place="margin">Silveſter.</note> though it be granted that the Covenant which God made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and with his ſeed, is a Covenant of grace, and that circumciſion was given as a ſeale of that Covenant unto his ſeed; yet ſtill, this is not proved, that God hath made a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace now in the new Teſtament with the ſeed of believers, eſpecially our naturall and carnall ſeed: Or that our Baptiſme is given to us of God in ſtead of circumciſion, to confirm ſuch a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with ſuch a ſeed.</p>
               <p>Both theſe may be well proved, rightly underſtood;<note place="margin">Silvanus.</note> rightly underſtood I ſay. For if by carnall ſeed of believers be meant the children of beleevers walking after the fleſh, and carnally rejecting the Covenant of grace, as <hi>Eſau</hi> ſold his birthright for a meſſe of pottage; and the Jews rejected the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh their own righteouſneſſe, (which are properly called by the Apoſtle the carnall ſeed, and Iſrael after the fleſh) then we willingly grant you, that the Covenant of grace is not extended to the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſeed of believe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s. Or if by carnall and naturall ſeed, be meant the children of believers begotten of their bodies, and conſidered as deſcending from them onely by power of nature, and carnall generation, then we conſent unto you herein alſo, that the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace doth not extend to the children of believers conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as their naturall and carnall ſeed. For the children of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, though begotten of their bodies, yet are born under the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, not by any power of nature, or any force of carnall gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: but, by the grace of Chriſt offering the Covenant to belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and to their ſeed, and by the faith of believers receiving the Covenant for themſelves and for their ſeed. But that the Covenant of beleevers begotten of their bodies, are borne under the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, by the grace of Chriſt offering the Covenant to them, and by the faith of their parents receiving the Covenant
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:113833:29"/> for them, and for their ſeed, may be proved from ſundry teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Scripture.</p>
               <p>Firſt, from the teſtimony of <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Galatians, Gal.</hi> 3.14, 15, 16. where he teacheth us, that by Chriſt his redemption of us from the curſe of the Law, the bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> is come upon the Gentiles, <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. This bleſſing is called the Covenant, <hi>verſe</hi> 15, 17. And this Covenant he calleth the promiſes, <hi>verſe</hi> 16. And theſe promiſes he there telleth us were made to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed: and by ſeed he meaneth Chriſt. And by Chriſt he meaneth Chriſt myſticall, that is, Chriſt and all that are in Chriſt, whether by election, or by their owne faith, (as all the living members of Chriſt be) or by adoption, as all the Iſraelites were, for whom <hi>Paul</hi> had continuall ſorrow, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4. Or (which is of like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent) by participation in the ſtocke of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the ſtock of the faithfull, as <hi>Paul</hi> calleth the Jews, the children of the ſtock of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> to whom the word of ſalvation is ſent, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.26. And ſuch are in Chriſt, as branches in the true olive, or in the vine, till they come to cut off themſelves, by caſting off the Covenant, and the faith of their parents. For the Apoſtle there in that place of the <hi>Galatians,</hi> ſpeaketh of the bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> as come upon us Gentiles: And the bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> was the Covenant and promiſes of the Covenant made unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> and unto his ſeed in Chriſt. Now that ſeed in Chriſt was of ſuch large extent, as that <hi>Iſmael</hi> at firſt partaked in the Covenant made to it, and in the ſeale of it (as being himſelfe one of the ſeed and ſtock of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as well as <hi>Iſaac</hi>) untill he rejected the Covenant in rejecting <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and the grace of Chriſt in him, and ſo was caſt out of the family of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and out of the Communion of the body of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh not there (as ſome of your way would have it) of a different diſpenſation of the Covenant of <hi>Abraham,</hi> in the old Teſtament, and in the new: as if it were diſpenſed in the old Teſtament unto him and to his carnall ſeed: and now in the New, to him, and to his ſeed in Chriſt; no, no ſuch matter. But he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of the Covenant as it was diſpenſed unto <hi>Abraham</hi> and to his ſeed of old. And his ſeed of old, was meant Chriſt, and all in Chriſt, then, as well as now. And therefore, if then <hi>Iſmael</hi> was received to the Covenant, and to the ſeale of the Covenant, as the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and yet no ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> was accounted in the Covenant, but the ſeed in Chriſt, it is evident that <hi>Iſmael</hi> was
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:113833:29"/> at firſt accounted to be in Chriſt, though not as elect in Chriſt, nor as united to Chriſt by his owne faith; yet as abiding like a branch in the ſtock of <hi>Abraham,</hi> in the body of the faithfull, in the adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, and in the communion of <hi>Abrahams</hi> family, till by perſecuting <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and by mocking at the grace of Chriſt in him, hee was cut off from that vine, and caſt out of the Covenant. Whence it followeth, that if the bleſsing of <hi>Abraham</hi> bee come upon us Gentiles, and this bleſsing of <hi>Abraham</hi> bee the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and Covenant made to him and his ſeed, and if the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> bee accounted all that are in Chriſt, and all are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted to bee in Chriſt, (in reſpect of the outward diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of the Covenant) not onely which are elect, and which are faithfull, but alſo which are of the ſeed of the faithfull, and live in communion with them, (till they come to reject Chriſt, and the faith in him) then it ſtandeth undeniably firme and certaine that the Covenant of <hi>Abraham</hi> is made with believers now, and and with our ſeed too, even in theſe dayes of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The ſame truth is witneſſed unto by the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> alſo in <hi>Acts</hi> 2.39. as hath been opened above. The promiſe (ſaith hee) is made to you and to your children; where by promiſe is meant (as appeareth by the former verſe) the promiſe of remiſſion of ſins, and of receiving the holy Ghoſt; which are of the principall ſort of the ſure mercies of the Covenant of grace.</p>
               <p>It will be a vaine ſhift to diſtinguiſh between the promiſe and the Covenant here. For every promiſe of God, is a promiſe of one Covenant or other. Now in the Covenant of works there is no free promiſe of remiſsion of ſins, or of the holy Ghoſt: but all the promiſes are given to workers, Doe this, and thou ſhalt live: doe it not, and die and be accurſed. In the New Teſtament there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is a Covenant of grace to beleevers and to their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as was to <hi>Abraham</hi> and to his ſeed. If it be ſaid, this Promiſe and Covenant was to the Jews, and to their children, but not to the Gentiles and theirs.</p>
               <p>The anſwer is plaine and eaſie, it is a promiſe of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and in the new Teſtament, the Jew hath no priviledge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Gentile. There is neither Jew nor Gentile, there is no difference of any Nation in the ſpirituall priviledges of the New Teſtament: but all are alike in Chriſt Jeſus. If it be ſaid again, the promiſe is to them, and to their repenting and believing children, and not elſe.</p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:113833:30"/>
               <p>This exception hath been refuted above. To which let mee adde, that the promiſe was not onely to the repenting and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Iſraelites, nor onely to their children repenting and believing; but God had promiſed alſo to poure his Spirit upon their children that they might repent and believe; when <hi>Jacob</hi> is thirſty, and like the dry ground, God promiſeth he will not onely pour out his Spirit like water upon him thus dry and thirſty; but alſo I will poure (ſaith he) my Spirit upon thy ſeed, and my bleſſing upon thine off-ſpring, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.3. For it is the ſame water of the bloud and ſpirit of Chriſt, of which God ſpeaketh, when he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth to poure cleane water upon them, and therewith to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their hard and ſtony hearts, which muſt be removed by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit given them, before they can come to repent and believe, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 26, 25.</p>
               <p>It is to the ſame purpoſe that upon the repentance and faith of <hi>Zacheus,</hi> the Lord pronounceth ſalvation to bee unto his houſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.9. This day (ſaith he) ſalvation is come to this houſe, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as he alſo is the ſon of <hi>Abraham:</hi> which is not only in reſpect of the Religious care, which <hi>Zacheus</hi> would take to teach his houſhould the way of ſalvation, but alſo in reſpect of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, by which not onely <hi>Zacheus</hi> was bound to teach his houſhold, but the Lord alſo had bound himſelf to bleſſe the meanes of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his houſhold, as it is written, The Lord thy God will cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſe thine heart, and the heart of thy ſeed, to love the Lord thy God, &amp;c. <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6. And againe, thoſe that dwell under his ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow ſhall returne, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14 7. The like promiſe of grace doth <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> preach to the Jaylor, that upon his faith, ſalvation ſhould redound to his houſhold; Believe (ſay they) on the Lord Jeſus, and thou ſhalt bee ſaved and thine houſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.31. which alſo was done and tooke effect the ſame night, afore that the Gaoler could take any great paines for the inſtruction of them, <hi>verſe</hi> 34. All which do plainly argue, that the faith of the parent doth bring the children and houſhold of a Chriſtian, even now in the days of the new Teſtament, under a Covenant of ſalvation, as well as the faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> brought his houſhold of old under the ſame co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. Whence alſo it is, that <hi>Paul</hi> proveth the converſion of the Jews (after the fulneſſe of the Gentiles be come in) from the Covenant of God made with their Fathers <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob.</hi> For (ſaith he) when the fulneſſe of the Gentiles is come in, all Iſrael ſhall be ſaved, as it is written, There ſhall come out of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:113833:30"/> 
                  <hi>Zion</hi> a Redeemer, and ſhall turne away ungodlineſſe from <hi>Jacob.</hi> For this is my Covenant unto them, when I ſhall take away their ſins: As concerning the Goſpel they are enemies for your ſake, but as touching the election, they are beloved for the Fathers ſake, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.25, 26, 27, 28. which plainly argueth, that for the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſake made with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> the Lord will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert and call home the Jews in the latter dayes, although for the preſent they be rejected for their unbelief. Therefore the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace (the Covenant of <hi>Abraham</hi>) is of like force and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent now (now in the dayes of the New Teſtament) unto the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and their ſeed, as it was in the dayes of the Old Teſtament.</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid, that this proveth no more, then this, that when the Jewes ſhall turne unto Chriſt by faith in their Redeemer, then they ſhall inherit the Covenant of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as all believers doe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, it proveth not that onely, but this more, that before their faith in Chriſt, whilſt they are yet enemies, the Lord will turne unto them, and give them faith and repentance to turne to him, and that out of his Covenant, even for the love that hee bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to them for their godly fathers ſake. Howbeit, we willingly grant that thoſe Jewes who ſhall be converted in the latter dayes, are no otherwiſe under the Covenant of grace, then in reſpect of Gods election, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.28. But otherwiſe in reſpect of the actuall enjoynment of the priviledges of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel (ſuch as Church-communion, and the ſeales of that Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion be) they are rejected as enemies, not for their privative want of faith, but for their poſitive rejection of the faith, and of the righteouſneſſe of faith, and of Chriſt himſelf. But when they ſhall turne unto the Lord, then the Covenant ſhall run along to them and to their ſeed, as it did of old unto <hi>Abraham</hi> and to his ſeed. For ſo <hi>Eſay</hi> prophecyeth of thoſe times, This is my Covenant to them that turn from tranſgreſſion in <hi>Iacob,</hi> my ſpirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, ſhall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeed, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeeds ſeed, from henceforth and for ever, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 59.20, 21.</p>
               <p>Finally, that known place in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. though it have beene much wreſted and racked to looke and ſpeake another way, yet it cannot but beare witneſſe to the truth in hand, that by the faith of either Parent, the children are received into a ſtate of holineſſe, and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:113833:31"/> ſo are accounted amongſt Gods holy people, which is by fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in the Covenant. By the text and context it appeareth, that in the church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> ſometimes the wife had been converted to Chriſtianity, when the husband ſtill remained an infidell (or as it is tranſlated, an unbeleever;) and ſometimes the husband had been converted, when the wife remained an infidell; whereupon it grew a juſt and weighty doubt, whether the believer were not bound in conſcience to put away the unbelieving yoke-fellow. And the doubt ſeemed to have juſt ground from that which might ſeem to be a like caſe in the old Teſtament, in the dayes of <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah;</hi> where ſuch as had maried ſtrange wives, were comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of God, and covenanted among themſelves, to put away both their ſtrange wives, and the children begotten of them, <hi>Ezra</hi> 10.2, 3. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 13.23, 24, 25. For reſolving this doubt (as well as of ſome others) the <hi>Corinthians</hi> by letter conſulted with the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. &amp;c. And to this doubt the Apoſtle anſwereth, that the believer ſhould not put away the unbelieving yoke-fellow. And for this he giveth a double reaſon.</p>
               <p>Firſt, from the ſanctification of the unbelieving yoke-fellow to the believer, <hi>verſe</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>Secondly, from the hope, or poſſibility at leaſt, which the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hath of converting the unbelieving yoke-fellow to the faith, <hi>verſe</hi> 16. Now the former of theſe reaſons (taken from the ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the unbelieving yoke-fellow to the believer) the Apoſtle proveth it by the ſtate of their children; Elſe were your children uncleane (ſaith he) but now they are holy.</p>
               <p>The force of this Reaſon ſtandeth thus,</p>
               <p>If the unbelieving yoke-fellow were not ſanctified in the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and to the believer (that is, if the believer had not a ſanctified uſe of his mariage communion with his unbelieving yoke-fellow) then were your children unclean.</p>
               <p>But your children are not uncleane, but now they are holy:</p>
               <p>Therefore the unbelieving yoke-fellow is ſanctified in the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and to him.</p>
               <p>Where, in the aſſumption, the Apoſtle putteth a manifeſt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene the eſtate of the children now in the dayes of the New Teſtament, and their eſtate in the Old, as in <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah</hi>'s time. In the Old Teſtament, as the unbelieving yoke-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low was uncleane to the Iſraelites, ſo were their children uncleane alſo: And therefore both wives and children to be put away. Why
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:113833:31"/> ſo? Becauſe then there was a partition wall between Jew and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, the Gentiles were then ſtrangers from the Covenants of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe (<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2 12.) and all communion with them was accurſed, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 13.25. more feare, then, that the infidell ſhould pervert the Iſraelite, then hope that the Iſraelite ſhould convert the infidell. But now, (to wit, now in the New Teſtament, now that the partition wall is broken downe between Jew and Gentile, now that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is extended to every believer in each Nation, and to his ſeed) now God is a God to the ſeed of every believer as to himſelfe, God hath promiſed to bee a Father to his children; and ſo they are holy by the holineſſe of his Covenant. And if the children bee holy, then the mariage fellowſhip of the Parents is ſanctified to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, though the other yokefellow remaine an infidell. And if the mariage fellowſhip be ſanctified, then the maried Parents may lawfully cohabite together, though the one a believer, the other an fidell. This is the plaine meaning and ſcope of the Apoſtles words, and diſcourſe. Which plainly and ſtrongly holdeth forth, that the grace of the Covenant is extended to the children of believing Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents in the new Teſtament, as much as in the Old, yea and more too. For in the Old Teſtament the Covenant reached not to the children, in caſe an Iſraelite had children by a Pagan wife, (whether <hi>Moabite, Ammonite,</hi> or <hi>Canaanite</hi>) but now if either of the Parents be believers, and ſo in Covenant, let the other Pagan Parent bee of what Nation ſoever, yet the children are in the Covenant, and ſo holy alſo.</p>
               <p>Theſe Scriptures which you have brought to prove that God hath made a Covenant of grace with believers and their ſeed,<note place="margin">Silveſter.</note> now in the dayes of the New Teſtament, I have heard ſundry exceptions made againſt them. <q>As firſt touching the place in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. It is ſaid, that if the place be well conſidered, it will helpe forward the truth againſt the receiving of children non-elect into the Covenant: For the Apoſtle here ſpeaketh of the Covenant, as comprehending Chriſt, and the ſeed in him elect, unto everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting life. In which ſenſe, the Covenant of grace was not made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to all his ſeed without exception: for then all his ſeed muſt either be ſaved, (which no man will ſay) or if they periſh, then muſt they fall out of the Covenant of grace. And if neither, then there were ſome of the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in the Covenant in one ſenſe, and admitted to the ſeale thereof, whom God excepted againſt in another ſenſe; ſome
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:113833:32"/> of which were <hi>Iſmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi>
                  </q> who in <hi>Abrahams</hi> generation ſignified a fleſhly ſeed, as well as <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> a ſpirituall. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween which ſeeds God ever held forth a diſtinction in all genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, from <hi>Abraham</hi> untill Chriſt, who put an end to the type and the fleſh, <q>to al priviledges of that nature thereunto belonging, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.3, 4, 5. So that now all is laid up in Chriſt one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for ſuch as believe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Silvanus.</note>It is a taking away from the Text, I meane a ſtraitning of the ſenſe of it, to ſay that <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. ſpeaketh of the ſeed elect in Chriſt unto eternall life. For he ſpeaketh of all the ſeed in <hi>Chriſt:</hi> now there are a ſeed in Chriſt, which are not elect in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf ſpeaketh of branches in him (the true vine, the fat olive tree) which yet bare no fruit in him, and ſo are cut off from him, caſt out and wither, <hi>John</hi> 15.2, 6. And ſuch branches though they were in Chriſt by the fellowſhip of the Church, and by the Spirit conveying from Chriſt common graces to them, yet they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver elect in him to everlaſting life, nor united to him by a lively faith. For if they had been ſo in him, they had never been cut off from him.</p>
               <p>It is true, the Covenant of grace was not to all the ſeed of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> without exception; that is, to ſuch of the ſeed as rejected the Covenant, or the faith of it, as <hi>Iſmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> did in riper years. But the Covenant was to all the infant ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> without exception, and to all the infants of his believing ſeed. And the ſeale of the Covenant was in like ſort diſpenſed to them all without exception, to <hi>Iſmael</hi> as well as to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> to <hi>Eſau,</hi> as well as to <hi>Jacob.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet nevertheleſſe, it will not therefore follow, that ſome of the <q>ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> were comprehended in the Covenant, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the ſeale thereof in one ſenſe,</q> whom God excepted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt in another ſenſe. For hee excepted not againſt the infant ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or his family in any ſenſe: but onely againſt the ſeed apoſtate in elder yeares. In reſpect of which Apoſtacy (which God fore-knoweth, all the non-elect ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> will fall into) though God receive all the infant-ſeed of <hi>Abrahams</hi> family (that is, of the Church) into the fellowſhip of the Covenant, and of the ſeale thereof, yet he giveth a peculiar bleſſing to the elect ſeed, even the ſure mercies of his Covenant, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 55.2. And though you ſay, that between theſe two ſeeds, God ever held forth a diſtinction in all generations from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Chriſt;</hi> yet that diſtinction was one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:113833:32"/> this; the ſeed of all the fleſh, and the ſeed of the promiſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.8. But he excluded neither of them in their infancy from the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, or from the ſeale of it: Indeed the children of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, being the elect of God, God hath not onely given his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to them and the ſeale thereof, but hath alſo eſtabliſhed it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them for ever. But the ſeed of the fleſh, though the Lord gave his Covenant even unto them alſo, and the ſeal therof; yet he hath not eſtabliſhed it unto them for ever; whence afterward it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe that they reject the Covenant and the faith of it. <q>But when you further ſay, that Chriſt hath put an end to the type, and to the fleſh, and to all priviledges thereunto belonging; ſo that now all is laid up in Chriſt onely for ſuch as believe, and for that end quote 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.3, 4, 5.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It is readily granted you, that Chriſt hath put an end to all types and to fleſhly Ordinances, and to the purifying of the fleſh, by the Ceremonies of the Law (<hi>Heb.</hi> 7.16. &amp; 9.13.) But that Chriſt hath put an end to all priviledges either of the Covenant, or of the ſeale of the Covenant to the ſeed of believers, there is no word in the New Teſtament that teacheth us any ſuch doctrine; the places alledged (opened above by me) prove the contrary; and thoſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by you will not make good what you ſay, for the place in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.16. that a man regenerate knoweth no man after the fleſh, argueth onely thus much, that a man in Chriſt reſteth in no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward priviledges, no not in ſeeing and knowing Chriſt in the fleſh, nor in eating and drinking in his preſence, nor in hearing him preach in their ſtreets, but in the ſpirituall and lively fellowſhip of his death and reſurrection, which maketh him whoſoever knoweth Chriſt, a new Creature. And ſo ſay we too; and ſo it was with the faithfull in the Old Teſtament as well as in the New. It was not the outward participation of the Covenant, nor of the ſeale of it, that a ſincere Iſraelite could reſt in, but in the grace of the Covenant, and Circumciſion of the heart in the Spirit, not in the Letter. But this doth not at all argue, that the children of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, who are yet in the fleſh, are not partakers of the Covenant of grace, nor of the ſeale of it, now in the New Teſtament, as well as they were in the Old. But only argueth, that though before regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, men are apt to reſt and boaſt in the outward Letter of privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and Ordinances: yet after regeneration they doe not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge ſuch things as their comfort and confidence. <hi>John Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt</hi> endeavoured to beat off the Jews from reſting in ſuch outward
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:113833:33"/> priviledges, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.9. And ſo did the Prophets before Chriſt, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 9.25, 26. as well as <hi>Paul</hi> after him, both in this place of the Corinthians, and that other which you quote out of <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.3, 4, 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>When you ſay, that now all is laid up in Chriſt onely for ſuch as believe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>If you meane all ſpirituall bleſſings of life and ſalvation, you ſay true, but nothing to the queſtion: For ſo it was in the Old Teſtament, as well as now. But as it was then, the ſeed of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers partaked of the outward diſpenſation of the Covenant, and of the ſeale of it; ſo is it ſtill, unleſſe you could ſhew us ſome Scripture whereby they are more excluded now then in the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament.</p>

                  <q>Now firſt in Chriſt by faith, and then to the Covenant and priviledges thereof, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.29. None by the Goſpel are approved to be the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but onely ſuch as walke in the ſteps of his faith. For as none inviſibly before God are by him ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved at all to have right to any priviledges of grace, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as he looketh upon them in his Son: no more are there any before man viſibly to be approved of, ſo as to have right to the ſame, but as they appeare to be in Chriſt, by ſome effect of faith declaring the ſame. And ſo much the more, in that God excludeth all from his holy Covenant, ſo as to have right in the outward diſpenſation thereof, but onely ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.20. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.18. &amp; 4.1, 2, 3. &amp; 11.5, 6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.7, 8. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.22, 26, 29.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Silvanus.</note>Surely in the old Teſtament, the children of believers had firſt Chriſt by Covenant, and then faith alſo to receive him. For in the Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> when God gave himſelfe to be a God to him and his ſeed, the Father gave himſelfe to bee their Father, the Son to be their Redeemer, the holy Ghoſt to bee their Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier, when yet the children were unborn, without life, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without faith. And ſurely in the New Teſtament God hath not changed this order of his bleſſings. For in rehearſing the Covenant (which continueth in the New Teſtament) he giveth the writing of the law in their hearts by Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10. Amongſt which laws, ſurely the law of faith is one, and indeed the chiefe of all other laws. And therefore it is not as you ſay, firſt faith, and then to the Covenant; but firſt the Covenant, and then faith written and wrought in their hearts by his Spirit to fulfill his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:113833:33"/> The place which you quote in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.29. doth not prove that none are the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſave thoſe that be in Chriſt by faith. But that thoſe who be in Chriſt by faith, they are that ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who partake in the ſure mercies of the Covenant: who are therefore called heires according to promiſe. The faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> they onely partake in the ſure mercies of the Covenant: ſo it is now in the New Teſtament, and ſo it was, and no otherwiſe in the Old. But that doth not at all hinder, but that all the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> though yet deſtitute of faith in their own perſons, have right to the outward diſpenſation of the Covenant and to the ſeale of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>When you ſay, none are approved by the Goſpel to be the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but onely ſuch as walke in the ſteps of his faith; the place whereto you alude,</q> is in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.12. which only holdeth forth, that ſuch as walke in the ſteps of the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> they are the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who are juſtified in the ſight of God: for <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelfe was ſo juſtified. And thus it is in the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, and thus alſo it was in the Old: And yet <hi>Abraham</hi> then had, and ſo have the faithfull now, other ſeed who are partakers of the covenant, and of the ſeale of the covenant, and yet are not juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for want of faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>You ſay, none inviſibly before God, are by him approved at all to have right to any priviledge of grace, but onely as he loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth upon them in his Son: no more are there any before men viſibly to be approved of, ſo as to have right to the ſame.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This ſaying (that none have right to any priviledge of grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, but as he looketh upon them in his Son) it is true, right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtood, but nothing availing to your purpoſe. If you mean by grace, ſaving grace, it is true; none have right to any priviledge of ſaving grace, but as God looketh at them in his Son, either by faith, or by election unto faith. If you meane by grace, the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward diſpenſation of the covenant of grace, and of the ſeal there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, it is true, none have right to any priviledge of the covenant, or of the ſeale of it, but as they are in Chriſt either by faith, or by election unto faith, or by their fellowſhip with the church, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Chriſt is the head. In which reſpect all the members of the church, and their ſeed are in Chriſt, as branches in the vine, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, and may be cut off from him for want of faith to make them fruitfull in him. But what avayleth this to your purpoſe? Thus it is in the new Teſtament, and thus it was in the Old.</p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:113833:34"/>
               <p>
                  <q>But when you ſay, none have right to the ſame, but as they appeare to be in Chriſt, by ſome effect of faith declaring the ſame.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This you cannot make good from Scripture light. For though you ſay, that God excludeth all from his holy covenant, ſo as to have right in the outward diſpenſation thereof, but onely ſuch as believe.</p>
               <p>And to prove that, you alledge many Scriptures; yet none of them beare witneſſe to any ſuch matter. All the Scriptures which you alledge will eaſily prove one of theſe two things, (both which we willingly grant) Firſt, that ſome branches in Chriſt were broken off from Chriſt, though not through want of faith, but yet through infidelity, rejecting the faith of Chriſt, either in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or in their parents. Secondly, that through faith wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſpirituall ſaving bleſſings of the covenant, and through want of faith fall ſhort of them; both which are everlaſting truths, as well before <hi>Chriſt</hi> as ſince.</p>
               <p>To runne over all your places briefly, that you may ſee how your Leaders miſ-leade both themſelves and you. In <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.20. it is ſaid, the Jewes were broken off through unbeliefe: So the word is tranſlated; but the true ſenſe of it is, through infidelity: and ſo the ſame word is tranſlated, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.15. What part hath a believer with an infidell? The meaning of that place in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> is, the Jews were broken off from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and from their church-eſtate and Covenant in him, by their profeſſed infidelity, their open rejection of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his righteouſneſſe, and that not out of ignorance, but out of wilfull obſtinacy againſt the light of the goſpel revealed to them. For the Apoſtles ſtill kept communion with them, as with a church, a people in covenant with God, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their want of faith in <hi>Chriſt;</hi> yea, notwithſtanding their crucifying of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> untill they wilfully &amp; obſtinately rejected and perſecuted the Goſpel of grace, and the righteouſneſſe of it, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.45, 46. And perſiſting therein, then indeed they were broken off; but yet this argueth that they were in Chriſt before; or elſe how could they now be broken off? Your next place is quoted out of <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.18. where the Iſraelites are ſaid to fall ſhort of their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into <hi>Canaan</hi> becauſe of their unbeliefe; the word is as before, becauſe of their infidelity. For it is not likely that all the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites who wanted ſaving faith, were kept out of <hi>Canaan: Acban</hi> who troubled Iſrael, doth not appeare to be a true believer. But
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:113833:34"/> the body of them who were kept out of <hi>Canaan,</hi> had carryed themſelves like infidels, they thought ſcorne of the land of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and preferred Pagan <hi>Egypt</hi> before it. And therefore for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting the promiſe and the faith of it, were juſtly rejected from entring into <hi>Canaan.</hi> But what maketh this to the purpoſe in hand? how doth this prove, that in the Goſpel God excludeth all from his holy Covenant, and from right in the outward diſpenſation of it, ſave onely ſuch as believe? For all theſe were in the Covenant, and had been circumciſed in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and ſo had the priviledge of the outward diſpenſation therof, though they believed not: Beſides, this concerned the times of the Old Teſtament; of which your ſelfe and your leaders confeſſe, that the outward diſpenſation of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and of the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lieving ſeed, but to the carnall alſo. Your next place in <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.1, 2, 3. proveth only, that ſuch as do not mixe the word with faith, will fall ſhort of entring into Gods reſt. So it was in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as well as in the New. And the Apoſtle himſelfe doth ſo expreſſe it; The Word (ſaith he) which was preached to them, (to wit, the Iſraelites in the old Teſtament) did not profit them, becauſe it was not mixed with faith in them that heard it: From whence he alſo argueth, that neither will the Word preached to us now, profit us, if it be not mixed with faith. But what maketh this to prove that God excludeth all from the outward diſpenſation of his holy Covenant, but onely ſuch as believe? Is it all one to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in the outward diſpenſation of Gods Covenant, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Gods reſt? or to profit by the Word? your Leaders ſhould make more conſcience of alledging and applying Gods holy Word impertinently, impertinently I ſay, both to Gods meaning, and to their owne: which is one kinde (but too frequent) of taking Gods holy name in vaine.</p>
               <p>The next place which you quote out of <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.5, 6. ſheweth us, that without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God; which argueth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that no man either in his perſon, or in his work can be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God without faith: but doth not prove that God cannot receive any into the outward fellowſhip of the Covenant without faith; much leſſe doth it prove, that the New Teſtament doth exclude all unbelievers from the Covenant, more then did the Old Teſtament; for thoſe words in <hi>Hebrews</hi> 11.5, 6. were ſpoken of <hi>Enoch,</hi> who (I need not tell you) lived in the dayes of the Old Teſtament.</p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:113833:35"/>
               <p>Your next place in <hi>Rom</hi> 97, 8. ſheweth indeed, that all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the fleſh of <hi>Abraham,</hi> are not the elect ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> (which we willingly grant) but doth not ſhew, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Your laſt place out of <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.22, 26, 29. argueth the ſame that the former places have done, that believers are partakers of Chriſt by faith, and of adoption by Chriſt; that they are the juſtified ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and heires according to promiſe. So was it in the Old Teſtament, and ſo is it ſtill to this day. But this doth not prove now, <q>no more then it did then, that all are excluded from the outward diſpenſation of the Covenant but believers onely.</q>

               <p>"Firſt, ſay you, that Covenant admitted of a fleſhly ſeed; this onely of a ſpirituall, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17, with <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The place in the Romans ſpeaketh of the ſeed of promiſe to be the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to be accounted not onely in the New Teſtament, but in the Old alſo. For the Oracle (in <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſhall thy ſeed be called, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.7.) was given to <hi>Abraham</hi> in the Old Teſtament, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.12. And that after <hi>Iſmael</hi> was caſt out of the Covenant for his mocking and perſecuting of <hi>Iſaac.</hi> So that this Scripture in <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.15. is three wayes wreſted and wronged in this Quotation.</p>
               <p>Firſt, in that it is brought to prove, that the Covenant of grace in the dayes of the new Teſtament admitteth onely of a ſpirituall ſeed; whereas <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh not of the Covenant of grace, but of the election of grace.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in that the place is brought to ſhew what is now the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:113833:36"/> ſeed in the New Teſtament different from that of the Old; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of the ſame ſeed both in the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alike.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in that <hi>Iſmael</hi> is accounted by you as a fleſhly ſeed, and ſo as rejected out of the Covenant from the womb; whereas he was not caſt out of the Covenant, till himſelfe caſt off the Covenant by mocking and perſecuting <hi>Iſaac.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The ſecond difference you put is, that that Covenant in the old Teſtament was in the fleſh; this in the heart, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.13. with <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.28, 29.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This difference is put by you, but not by the Spirit of God in Scripture. For as that Covenant (that is, the ſigne of the Covenant) was in the fleſh: ſo is Baptiſme (the ſigne of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant now) upon the fleſh.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as our Baptiſme ſignifieth and ſealeth the waſhing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of the filth of fleſh and ſpirit; ſo did their circumciſion of the fleſh ſignifie and ſeale the circumciſion of the heart, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, as in our Baptiſme the Lord doth not regard nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme the outward waſhing of the fleſh, (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21.) So nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was the circumciſion of the fleſh without circumciſion of the heart of any account before God, either before Chriſt, or ſince. It was not only ſo adjudged in <hi>Pauls</hi> time in the New Teſtament, that Circumciſion of the fleſh, was nothing without Circumciſion of the heart, but alſo in <hi>Ieremies</hi> time in the Old Teſtament. For <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy</hi> threatneth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hat God will puniſh the circumciſed with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed, <hi>Egypt, Edom, Ammon</hi> and <hi>Moab</hi> with <hi>Iudah:</hi> for all theſe Nations are uncircumciſed; &amp; al the houſe of Iſrael are uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed in heart, <hi>Ier.</hi> 9.25, 26. It hath been ſaid of old, ſhall a man make Gods to himſelf, and they are no Gods? So may it be ſaid in ſome proportion, ſhall a man make differences to himſelf to turn him off from the way of God, and they are no differences?</p>
               <p>To the third, there is as little difference in that as in the former: for as the ſeale of that Covenant confirmed faith in things to come, but the ſeale of this confirmes faith in things already done: ſo the ſeale of that Covenant confirmed the faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> in the righteouſneſſe of faith, which he had already received; and the faith of thoſe that were in <hi>Canaan</hi> of the poſſeſſion of it: And our Baptiſme ſealeth up to us mortification of ſin, deliverance out of affliction, reſurrection of the body, whereof ſome are yet to come
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:113833:36"/> in part, ſome wholly. The like may bee ſaid of the other Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the Covenant. But what is it to the purpoſe? what if ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry ordinances of the Covenant, as it was diſpenſed in the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, confirmed faith in things to come? and what if the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the New Teſtament confirmed faith in things paſt? yet what is this to argue that children of believing Parents are excluded from the Covenant of grace in the new teſtament, though not in the Old?</p>
               <p>
                  <q>To the fourth, when you ſay, that Covenant was Nationall, and admitted all of the Nation to the ſeales thereof: But this perſonall, and admitteth of none but ſuch as believe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This difference is founded in an untruth: for it is untrue, that the Covenant given to <hi>Abraham</hi> was Nationall, it was rather do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticall at firſt: and did not comprehend the whole Nation of any of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, till <hi>Iacobs</hi> time. And <hi>Iacob</hi> ſpeaketh of his bleſſing (which was a proper adjunct, and peculiar priviledge of the Covenant) that it did exceed the bleſſing, and ſo the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant) of his progenitors, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.26. For whereas in <hi>Abrahams</hi> houſe, though <hi>Iſaac</hi> was received to the bleſſing of continuance in the Covenant, yet <hi>Iſmael</hi> and the ſeed of <hi>Keturah</hi> were excluded: and in <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s houſe, though <hi>Iacob</hi> inherited the bleſſing, yet <hi>Eſau</hi> was excluded, yet in <hi>Iacobs</hi> family all his ſonnes were received to the bleſſing of continuance under the outward diſpenſation of the Covenant, and not themſelves onely, but all their poſterity, the whole twelve Tribes, which proceeded from them. Now it is not ſaid in Scripture, that the bleſſing of <hi>Jacob</hi> is come upon the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, (for then none of our poſterity might cut themſelves off from the outwa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d diſpenſation of the Covenant, and then our Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant would be Nationall, and admit all of the Nation to the ſeales thereof) but the Scripture ſaith, that the bleſſing of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> (and ſo the Covenant of <hi>Abraham</hi>) is come upon the Gentiles, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.14. that is, upon the believing Gentiles, and their ſeed, whereby it commeth to paſſe, that believing Gentiles, and their Infant-ſeed are admitted to the Covenant, and to the ſeale of the Covenant, as <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Infant ſeed were: But if when they bee growne up to yeares, they ſhall grow to mocke and ſleight the Covenant, as <hi>Iſmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> did, then they and their ſeed are caſt out of the Covenant, and that keepeth the Covenant from being national. And ſo it was in <hi>Abrahams</hi> time, &amp; ſo it is now.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>When you ſay, this Covenant with us is perſonall and admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth onely of ſuch as believe.</q>
               </p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:113833:37"/>
               <p>It hath been refuted above, and this truth cleared, that upon the faith of the Parents, the grace of the Covenant is promiſed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo unto their ſeed. And if the Covenant did admit onely of ſuch as believe, then the faith whereby we believe, were not given to any by Covenant. Whereas it hath been ſhown above, that faith, and the ſaving knowledge of God by faith, and the writing of the Law of faith (as well as of love) in our hearts, is given by Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33.34.</p>
               <p>Your fifth difference is like the reſt, deviſed in your own ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, not founded in Scripture. <q>That Covenant (ſay you) begot children after the fleſh; but this onely begets children af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Spirit, and onely approveth of ſuch as are begotten and born from above, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Doe you any where read in Scripture, that the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of <hi>Abraham</hi> approved of any then, more then now, but ſuch as are begotten from above? Did not <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old renounce the owning and acknowledgement of ſuch children of theirs, as were degenerate from their faith and obedience? <hi>Eſay</hi> 63.16.</p>
               <p>When you ſay that that Covenant begot children after the fleſh, doe you not meane, that men under that Covenant begot children after the fleſh? And if that be your meaning, doe you thinke it is not ſo now, that men under the Covenant of grace, now in the dayes of the New Teſtament, as well as in the Old, doe beget chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren after the fleſh? It is true, thoſe believing Parents who doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get children by believing the Promiſe and Covenant of grace to them and to their children they doe bring forth, and bring up ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall children, or as you call it, children after the Spirit. But ſo did <hi>Abraham</hi> and other faithfull parents in the Old Teſtament, as well as now.</p>
               <p>The places which you quote out of <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. <hi>Ezek</hi> 36. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.5, 6. doe neither prove your aſſertion, nor diſprove ours, but rather approve it. For in <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. the Law of faith and ſaving knowledge is written in our hearts by the Covenant: ſo it is now in the New Teſtament, and ſo it was in the Old.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. God takes away the heart of ſtone, and gives an heart of fleſh, and a new ſpirit; ſo hee doth now to his choſen; and ſo he did then, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.24. The place in the <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. is the ſame with that in <hi>Ieremy</hi> 31. That in <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.5; 6. argueth that none born of fleſh can enter into the kingdome of heaven, but are
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:113833:37"/> carnall and fleſhly. But thus it was in the Old Teſtament, as well as in the New; there is no difference in this point.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Your ſixth difference is, that that Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his poſterity before Chriſt, comprehended a civill ſtate, and a worldly government, with the like carnall ſubjects for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the ſame: But this Covenant now under Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth onely a ſpirituall ſtate, and an heavenly govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with the like ſpirituall ſubjects of this alſo.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The Civill State and worldly government was not expreſſed in the Covenant given to <hi>Abraham,</hi> but in the Covenant, and bleſſing of <hi>Iacob.</hi> It was <hi>Iacob</hi> that bleſſed his ſon <hi>Iudah</hi> with a ſcepter, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.10. But to <hi>Abraham</hi> it was foretold, that his ſeed ſhould bee a ſtranger and a ſervant, and in an afflicted eſtate 400 yeares. And though the Lord did not deny them civill govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet neither did he expreſly promiſe it to his ſeed. And (as was ſaid above) it is the bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> that is come upon us, and not of <hi>Iacob,</hi> ſo far as that of <hi>Iacob,</hi> exceeded the bleſſing of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. It is more then can be proved, that the Covenant of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his poſterity after Chriſt, doth not comprehend a civill State: for the prophecy of <hi>Daniel</hi> promiſeth, that after the <q>deſtruction of the four Monarchies, the Kingdom and the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and the greatneſſe of the Kingdome under the whole hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſhall be given to the people of the ſaints of the moſt High, &amp;c. <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.27.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 3. Civill State and Government is but an acceſſary to the Covenant; And though the people of God in the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould never enjoy it, (which is not to be granted:) yet what is this to the maine promiſe of the Covenant, That God will bee a God to his people, and to their ſeed, throughout all generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?</p>
               <p>The ſeventh and laſt difference which you put is as little pertinent to the cauſe, as all the former. <q>For what if that Covenant held forth Chriſt in the fleſh to an heart vailed? And this holdeth him forth in the Spirit to a face open, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Yet this argueth onely a different diſpenſation of the Covenant by <hi>Moſes</hi> and by <hi>Chriſt;</hi> But the Covenant of <hi>Abraham</hi> which was given 430 yeares before the Covenant of <hi>Moſes,</hi> did not ſo vaile, nor darken the face of Chriſt, but that <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaw Chriſt, though afarre off, yet clearely, and rejoyced, <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>hn</hi> 8.56. And ſo did all his
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:113833:38"/> ſpirituall ſeed after him, more or leſſe, as well as wee. But what if the diſpenſation of the Covenant had been more vayled in all the times of the Old Teſtament to all the ſeed, then indeed it was? yet what is this to the maine promiſe of the Covenant, that God will be a God to a believer and his ſeed, throughout all generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?</p>

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Silveſter.</note>But let the differences of the Covenant before or ſince <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſtand or fall as they may: yet it is no good conſequence from the Covenant, that as infants were in that Covenant then, and circumciſed, ſo infants are in the Covenant now, and to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized. For let theſe foure things be well conſidered, and they will cleare the contrary.</p>
                  <p n="1">"1. What the Covenant is?</p>
                  <p n="2">"2. What is that which admits into the Covenant?</p>

                     <note place="margin">Silveſter.</note>The Covenant it ſelfe is a Covenant of grace and ſalvation, by which God of his grace takes a perſon or a people to himſelf above all others, to be their God, and to manifeſt upon them the riches of his grace and glory.</p>
                  <p>And the manner of this is in effect, Gods calling of a man to an agreement with himſelf in his Son, wherein he promiſeth to be his God, and to give him life and happineſſe, and all things in Chriſt; and that he ſhall believe and reſt upon his faithfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and truth, and ſo take him for his God, &amp;c. So that the Covenant conſiſteth of 3. Eſſentialls: 1. The perſons (two or moe) diſpoſed to agree. 2. Something to agree upon. 3. Their mutuall conſent, which is the agreement it ſelf.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Silvanus.</note>As the heavens are higher then the earth, ſo are the wayes of God higher then our wayes, (<hi>Eſa.</hi> 55.9.) and in ſpeciall the wayes of his grace, and of the Covenant thereof, with men indeed mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall agreement and conſent is neceſſary to a Covenant, but with God, Gods appointment maketh a Covenant, whether the creature conſent to an agreement or no. God ſometimes made a Covenant, and eſtabliſhed it, not onely with <hi>Noah</hi> and his ſeed, but alſo with the Fowles and Beaſts, and every living creature, that he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſend a flood to deſtroy them from off the face of the earth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.9, 10, 11. And this Covenant was onely an appointment of God,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:113833:38"/> it did not require any conſent or agreement of man, much leſſe of other creatures, to make it a Covenant. It is therefore a manifeſt error, to make the agreement or conſent on mans part eſſentiall to a Covenant between God and man.</p>
               <p>It is a ſecond error, that in deſcribing the Covenant of grace, you omit the ſeed of believers, &amp; exclude them from the fellowſhip of the Covenant, as being unable to expreſſe their conſent and agreement to the Covenant. Let it be conſidered in the feare of God, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ever God made any Covenant with any man or people, which did not comprehend their poſterity alſo? God made a Covenant with <hi>Noah</hi> did, it not reach his poſterity alſo? <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. God made a Covenant with <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17. did it not reach his poſterity al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo? God made a Covenant with the people of Iſrael, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. did it not reach their poſterity alſo? God made a Covenant with <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nehas, Numb.</hi> 25. did it not reach to his poſterity alſo? God made a Covenant with <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 89.28. did it not reach to his poſterity alſo? If then the Scripture never hold forth any Covenant which ever God made with any of the ſons of men, but it did reach and comprehend his poſterity alſo; why ſhould the Covenant of grace be conceived to run a different courſe from all the reſt of Gods co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants, namely, to reach unto believers, but not to their poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? We are ſhallow and narrow our ſelves, and ſo we meaſure the grace of God, and the Covenant thereof, according to our owne ſcantling, our narrow capacity. Proceed then to declare, what is <q>the ſecond thing you wiſht might bee well conſidered: to wit, what is that which admits into the Covenant?</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That which admits any into the Covenant,<note place="margin">Silveſter.</note> and giveth right to enter thereinto, is the promiſe of God in Chriſt, and faith in the ſame, as <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9.8.</q> The Covenant hath theſe eſſentiall parts and viſible branches. 1. Grace in the agent, God. 2. Faith in the ſubject, Man. 3. An uniting or cloſing of theſe together: which <q>is that mutuall conſent and agreement, by faith in the ſame grace revealed by the goſpel, which is the word of reconciliation. So that it is the bleſſed word of life and faith in the ſame, that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth right and admitteth into Covenant with God.</q>

                  </q> And your ſelf with your Leaders doe eaſily acknowledge, that in the old Teſtament, the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of <hi>Abraham</hi> admitted his carnall ſeed into the fellowſhip of it.

But proceed to your third thing which you woul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <note place="margin">Silveſter.</note>
                  <q>The third thing to be conſidered, is, who are the approved ſubjects of this Covenant; and they are onely ſuch as believe. For God in his Word approveth of none in Covenant with him out of Chriſt, nor of any in Chriſt without faith. Nay, God denyeth his approving of any in fellowſhip with him, that doe not believe, as <hi>John</hi> 3.5, 6, 36. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. Nor doth he approve of any ſubjects of his gracious Covenant, but onely ſuch as hee hath elected and choſen in Chriſt, and ſo appearing by ſome fruits and effects of the ſame, as theſe Scriptures (with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) witnes,</q> 
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9.29, 30. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.7. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.4, 5, 6. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13, 14. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.47. &amp; 13.48.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Silvanus.</note>There is a broad difference between theſe two; who are the true approved ſubjects of this Covenant; and who are appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be the true ſubjects of this Covenant. For it is certain (and your ſelfe admitted it above) that God approved all the ſeed of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> (even his carnall ſeed) to be admitted as ſubjects of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and of the ſeale thereof. But it as certain, that God never approved ſuch true ſubjects of the Covenant, whom himſelfe never elected, nor themſelves ever received the gift of faith, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which it is impoſſible to pleaſe God. Many are truly called to the fellowſhip of the Covenant, and of the ſeale thereof, who were never elected nor approved in their ſpirituall eſtate as heires of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. It is in the ſame ſenſe, that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh (<hi>Rom.</hi> 2.28, 29.) He is not a Jew, which is one without, neither is that Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is outward in the fleſh; but hee is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and Circumciſion is that of the heart in the Spirit,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:113833:39"/> whoſe praiſe (or which is all one, whoſe approbation) is not of men, but of God. But dare any man therefore inferre, that God did not approve it, that any ſhould bee admitted unto the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or unto the ſeale thereof (Circumciſion:) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he were a Jew, or Iſraelite within, and circumciſed with the circumciſion of the heart? To what purpoſe then are all the texts of Scripture alledged by you? which prove no more then wee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that by naturall generation all men are carnall; that without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God; that whom God ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth hee calleth; that the election obtaineth what they ſeeke for; that the elect are choſen to be holy, and partakers of the ſprinkling of the blood of Chriſt; that the elect are brought on to faith. But what is all this to prove that ſuch as are carnall by naturall genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, cannot be holy by the grace of the covenant? or that it may not pleaſe God to admit them to the outward diſpenſation of his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, whoſe inward ſpirituall eſtate hee is not pleaſed with?</p>
               <p>Surely all the Iſraelites in the wilderneſſe were ſometimes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into Covenant with God: yet with many of them God was not pleaſed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5. What though thoſe whom God el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth he calleth (to wit, by an effectuall calling, according to his purpoſe:) yet may hee not, yea, doth he not call many to place in his vineyard, (the Church) yea, to office alſo whom he hath not choſen? <hi>Mat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

May not therefore the non-elect partake in the outward diſpenſation of the Covenant, and yet afterwards bee hardened in hypocriſie? What though the elect onely come on to believe, though not with a juſtifying faith, yet with an hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and temporary faith? May they not bee holy by Covenant, who yet are not holy by the Spirit of Regeneration? May they not be ſprinkled with the blood of ſprinkling unto the common graces of the Spirit (<hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29.) who yet are not ſprinkled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to the remiſſion of their ſins? Finally, what though it bee ſaid, the Lord added to the Church daily ſuch as ſhould bee ſaved, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.47? were not <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira</hi> added alſo, and <hi>Simon Magus</hi> too, who yet (for ought that appeareth) were none of them ſaved?</p>

               <p>
                  <q>The fourth and laſt is,<note place="margin">Silveſter,</note> whether that all perſons now in the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:113833:40"/> Goſpel, have not one and the ſame way of entrance into the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant? let the holy Word of God bee judge, and I finde the Goſpel of Chriſt to approve of none in the Lords holy Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, but ſuch as believe: nor any approved of to be in the way of life, but ſuch as are in Chriſt by Faith. And therefore no other way of comming into the Covenant of grace and ſalvation, but onely by Jeſus Chriſt; for in him are all the promiſes confirmed, and made over onely unto ſuch as doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, as 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.4. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.11, 12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9.</q>
               </p>
               <p>You now labour againe of the ſame fallacy, which was noted in you before. It is readily granted you, that the Goſpel of Chriſt approveth of none in the Lords Covenant, but ſuch as believe.</p>
               <p>Neither did the Old Teſtament approve any in the Lords Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, but ſuch as believed. But as hath been ſaid, it is one thing to approve them in the Covenant, another thing to approve them to be in the Covenant. See it in a ſimilitude, God did never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove either <hi>Saul</hi> or <hi>Jehu</hi> in the Kingdome of Iſrael; yet hee did approve it that both of them ſhould be admitted to the kingdome. So is it here, God did never approve <hi>Iſmael</hi> in <hi>Abrahams</hi> houſe, nor <hi>Eſau</hi> in <hi>Iſaacs.</hi> And yet he approved it, that they ſhould be in their Fathers houſes, and alſo bee admitted to the Covenant of their Fathers, and to the ſeale thereof, till their own prophaneneſſe caſt them out.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>And therefore what though there bee no other way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into the Covenant of grace, but only by Jeſus Chriſt? And what though in Chriſt all the promiſes are confirmed, and made over onely to ſuch as believe?</q> Yet nevertheleſſe Chriſt hath opened a way for the comming of the Covenant and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes through himſelfe, not onely to ſuch as believe, but alſo (for their ſakes) to their children and houſholds. In the Old Teſtament God proſpered <hi>Iſmael</hi> for <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſake, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.13, 17, 18, 19, 20. In the New Teſtament God viſited with grace and ſalvation, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of <hi>Zacheus,</hi> and of the Jaylor for the houſholders ſake, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.9. <hi>Acts</hi> 16.31.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Silveſter.</note>
                  <q>The holy Covenant conſiſteth of three eſſentialls for entrance thereinto. Firſt, the word of God to reveale the ſame. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Chriſt to open the way, and to enright the party there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Thirdly, faith, without which none can enter thereinto, for as none can come unto God, or into Covenant with him,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:113833:40"/> but by Chriſt; ſo none can come unto Chriſt, but by faith, <hi>Job.</hi> 14.6. with <hi>John</hi> 6.44, 45. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. Let all this be well conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and then ſee how infants can be diſcovered to be in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and what way of entrance hath God by his word appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for them to come in, and denyed the ſame unto other.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I will not ſtraine at your word Eſſentialls;<note place="margin">Silvanus.</note> though all things that are neceſſary to the entrance or being of a thing, are not ſtraightway eſſentiall to it. Gods providence is neceſſary to the being and entrance of ſin, but it is not eſſentiall to it. But I willingly admit of your three neceſſary Ingredients for entrance into the Covenant, and finde none of them wanting to enſtate and intereſt the Infants of believing Parents into the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the Word of God revealeth ſuch a Covenant of grace, wherein God giveth himſelfe to be a God to the faithfull Parent, and to his ſeed. So hee gave himſelfe to faithfull <hi>Abraham</hi> and to his ſeed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. This Covenant of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Scripture revealeth to be come upon the believing Gentiles and their ſeed, as hath been ſhewed above.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Chriſt himſelfe hath opened the way to enright the children of believing Parents into the Covenant, by redeeming us (Gentiles, as well as Jews) from the curſe of the Law, that the bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> might come upon the Gentiles, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13, 14. And the bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> is to a believer and his ſeed, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. And this hath been further cleared above.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, faith is not wanting, to enſtate the ſeed of believing Parents into the Covenant, ſeeing God hath promiſed upon the faith of the Parent, ſalvation to his houſhold, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.31. <hi>Luke</hi> 19.9.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>It is a vaine exception to ſay, that if infants bee entred into the Covenant by the faith of their Parents, that then they who bee not naturally begotten and born in the Covenant, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed the ſame way of entrance into the Covenant which is granted to infants.</q>
               </p>
               <p>For firſt, wee doe not ſay, that any man is naturally begotten and born in the Covenant: For the children of believing parents are naturally the children of wrath, as well as others, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.3. But yet nevertheleſſe, though naturally they bee the children of wrath, yet by vertue and grace of the Covenant, they are holy, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14.</p>

               <p>Secondly, though they who are not begotten and borne of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Parents, cannot plead right in the Covenant, by the faith of their Parents: yet they may claime it by their owne faith, if God grant it to them. If not, it is no marvaile to a Chriſtian heart, that the faith of believing Parents conveyeth a greater bleſſing to their children, then unbelieving Parents can expect to themſelves, or theirs. Doth not obedience to the Law convey a farre greater bleſſing unto a godly man and his ſeed, even to a thouſand genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, then a wicked carnall parent can expect to him and his? <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.5, 6.

                  <q>If infants be in the Covenant of grace by vertue of their birth from believing parents, then ſuch infants are borne in a ſaving ſtate of grace, and were never out of the ſame. Which doctrine maketh void many heavenly and divine truths, which ſpeake to the contrary: which lay all under ſinne and curſe, till Chriſt by his blood redeeme them, and by his heavenly voice call them, and by his Spirit beget them unto a lively hope: who are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaid to bee borne againe from above. For none can be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der grace, and under wrath and curſe at one and the ſame time, in the outward diſpenſation of the ſame.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Silvanus.</note>It doth not follow that if infants be in the Covenant of grace by vertue of their birth from believing parents, then ſuch infants are borne in a ſaving ſtate of grace. For the Covenant of grace doth not give ſaving grace to all that are in the Covenant, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the elect: Nor doth it give ſaving grace to them alwayes in their birth, but in the ſeaſon wherein the Lord in his purpoſe of election had fore-appointed to give it to the children whom God hath not elected. The Covenant of grace doth not give them ſaving grace at all, but onely offereth it, and ſealeth what it offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.</p>
               <p>Neither doth this make void any heavenly and divine truth at all. For though all bee under ſinne and wrath and curſe til Chriſt by his blood redeem them, and by his heavenly voice call them, by his Spirit beget them: yet Chriſt was a Lambe ſlaine (in reſpect of the vertue and efficacy of his death) from the beginning of the world. And though elect veſſels may bee under the curſe till they bee called and regenerated from above, yet are they at one and the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:113833:43"/> ſame time under grace, but in divers reſpects: Under the curſe and wrath by nature; under grace by the election of God, and the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of their fathers. At one and the ſame time <hi>Apiathar</hi> was a man of death by deſert, and yet by the Kings favour a man of life, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 2 26. The Iſraelites at one and the ſame time were enemies for our ſakes, and yet beloved for their fathers ſake, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.28. And in very truth, if the elect children of God were not under grace before Chriſt call them by his heavenly voyce, or before hee regenerate them by his Spirit, how is it poſſible they ſhould be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually called, or regenerate at all? For in the feare of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, is not effectuall calling a regeneration, a worke of Gods grace in Jeſus Chriſt? is it not a fruit of Gods electing and redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming grace in Chriſt? The one wrought for us before the world was made, the other before wee were borne? And can the ſin of our nature which followed after, extinguiſh or make voyd the rich grace of Chriſt, which was before all cauſes in us? If effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall calling and regeneration bee the worke of Gods grace, then it is the effect of Gods grace; and if it be the effect of Gods grace, then the grace of Chriſt is the efficient cauſe of our effectuall cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and regeneration; and the efficient cauſe is alwayes in nature, and ordinarily in time before the effect. And therefore it cannot be, but that the elect children of God are under grace before their effectuall calling and regeneration. It is not our Doctrine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore but yours, that maketh void many heavenly and divine truths, even the fundamentall truths of the free grace of Chriſt. which your predeceſſors in this way did plainly diſcerne; and therefore they thought it beſt not to contradict themſelves as you doe, <q>To ſay, that children are not under grace, nor under a Covenant of grace, till they be called by Chriſts heavenly voice, and by his Spirit begotten from above; and yet withall to grant election and regeneration to be of grace.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But they ſeeing plainly theſe could not ſtand together, the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denyed election to bee of grace, but of foreſeen faith or works. And they denyed alſo regeneration to bee of Gods free grace, but of mans free will: which whether it make void many heavenly and divine truths of grace, let the word and Spirit of grace judge.

               <p>But what exception have you heard or read againſt the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Jews, out of reſpect to the Covenant of their Fathers, according to <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.26, 27, 28?</p>

               </p>
               <p>The Books in which you read of divers difficulties about the Jews comming in; they ſpeake not without cauſe,<note place="margin">Silvanus.</note> there be diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties indeed about the ſame: And I may tell you more, they are difficulties impoſſible to bee aſſoyled, according to the Tenents and Principles of thoſe Books. For grant that for truth which the Apoſtle expreſſely teacheth for a Myſtery, That after the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Gentiles bee come in, (to wit, come in from their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian Apoſtaſle) that then all Iſrael ſhall bee ſaved, (upon whom in the meane time blindneſſe lyeth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.25, 26.) And grant this alſo for a truth, (which the Apoſtle likewiſe expreſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly addeth, Verſe 27, 28.) that this ſhall bee out of reſpect of Gods love Covenanted with their Fathers, then this will prove a difficulty inexplicable, how God in the New Teſtament ſhall convert the poſterity of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> out of his love to their Fathers, and yet no man is partaker of grace by the Covenant of his Fathers, till himſelfe doth actually believe. For can men actually believe till they be converted? And is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion it ſelfe made a fruit and effect of Gods love? (his Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted love) unto their Fathers, and for the Fathers ſake unto their ſeed?</p>
               <p>Beſides, this will be another difficulty (and as hard to be reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as the former) how the Apoſtle can call the Jewes the naturall branches of the good Olive tree, and make their converſion much more kindly, and as it were, more eaſie and naturall, then the converſion of the Gentiles was; and yet hold (as your Bookes doe) that in the New Teſtament, God hath not reſpect in his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to the naturall ſeed or branches at all. It is eaſily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged and juſtly bewayled by the fall of our firſt Parents, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of nature is alike in all men: Converſion unto grace is
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:113833:45"/> as much above and againſt the corrupt nature of the Jews, as of the Gentiles. But yet preſuppoſe a covenant of grace with the believing Anceſtors of the Jews to continue in the dayes of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to their natural poſterity. And then it wil be eaſie to conceive, how the Jewes though by corrupt nature they are as averſe to be graffed into Chriſt as the Gentiles be, yet by nature of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, they are much more eaſily graffed in then the Gentiles. More eaſily (I ſay) not in reſpect of their owne <gap reason="foreign">

But take away the Covenant of grace from believing parents to their children; and truly this difficulty of the more eaſie converſion of naturall branches will prove (as the former did) inexplicable.</p>
               <p>Moreover, there will yet bee another difficulty (and as hard as both the former) how to make good ſenſe of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Argument, whereby he proveth the converſion and holineſſe of the Jewes in future ages, from the holineſſe of their godly An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors in times paſt: and yet deny (as your Bookes doe) the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the Covenant of grace, from believing Parents to their naturall children now in the dayes of the New Teſtament.

And that there ſhall be ſuch a receiving of them; he proveth, from the holineſſe, which by the inſtitution of God is derived from the firſt fruits to the whole lumpe; and by the Covenant of God from the root to the branches, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. For (ſaith hee) if the firſt fruits be holy, ſo is the whole lumpe; and if the root be holy, ſo are the branches.</p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:113833:45"/>
               <p>The force of this Argument dependeth upon the force of the Covenant of grace, and the continuance thereof from parents to their naturall children, even now in the dayes of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as well as of the Old. For by the tenor of the Covenant God is a God to holy Fathers, and to their ſeed after them. And if God be a God to their ſeed, it reacheth forth a twofold bleſſing to their ſeed, that all their ſeed are holy by Gods adoption (<hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4.) and ſo by their appropriation and relation unto God, till themſelves doe reject him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that ſome or other of them God will ever reſerve (to wit, all the elect ſeed) to be called effectually to the fellowſhip of his holineſſe, and to the holineſſe of their holy Anceſtors. And theſe bleſſings being preſuppoſed and granted by Covenant, the Apoſtles argument is plaine and ſtrong: That if the Patriarchs <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> be holy, (who were the firſt fruits, and the root of the houſe of Iſrael) then, as all the houſe of Iſrael were an holy people till they obſtinately rejected the Lord Jeſus. So will God reſerve an elect ſeed of them to be called and received to the fellowſhip of his holineſſe, and the holineſſe of their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors in his due time. But if you abrogate the continuance of the Covenant of grace from holy Parents to their naturall children now in the dayes of the New Teſtament, it will bee a difficulty (in my weake judgement) paſt all reſolution, how the Apoſtles Argument can be of any force to prove the converſion of the Jews unto holineſſe from the holineſſe of their Anceſtors, ſeeing their Anceſtors are no firſt fruits and root unto them, till they come to bee converted, and being converted, doe believe as well as their Anceſtors. And whether ever they will come to bee converted or no, is as uncertain (for all their relation to their holy Anceſtors, and for all their Anceſtors Covenant with God) as is the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of any other Infidels.</p>

                  <q>And whereas you ſay, the Word doth not juſtifie any, but with reſpect to actuall faith:</q>
               </p>
               <p>There is an ambiguity in your word, actuall faith; for actuall faith may be meant, either faith actually indwelling in the heart; or faith actually expreſſing it ſelfe in ſome acts or fruits of profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:113833:49"/> God was not pleaſed, had been all of them juſtified, for they were all in the Covenant. If you mean actuall faith in the latter ſenſe, your ſpeech is untrue.

For they who are filled with the holy Ghoſt from the wombe (as <hi>John Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt,</hi> and <hi>Jeremy</hi> were) they are ſanctified: And they who are ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, are alſo juſtified: And yet their faith did not at that age ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe it ſelfe actually in fruits of profeſſion.</p>

               <p>For faith it ſelfe is the life of the ſoule (the juſt man liveth by his faith:) and is it a convenient ſpeech, yea, is it not abſurd to ſay, faith enrights to it ſelfe? But what is it that enrights to faith, and and ſo to life by faith?

From which they for their unbelief are cut off; and the Gentiles by faith admitted in, of meere grace, and not to boaſt. And yet there is a remnant of them to be called as the Lumpe, and a ſecond fruit, which are alſo holy in reference to the ſame holy root as aforeſaid. And as the root is holy, ſo ſhall theſe branches be when they come to bee graffed in againe to their own root and olive tree, as at the firſt, which is union and communion with God in his holy way of Worſhip. And ſo much of the root or olive tree, which muſt bee underſtood of Chriſt myſtically conſidered; and not of beleeving Parents, as aforeſaid.

                  <q>Firſt, they are branches onely, as they ſubſiſt and grow in the root or vine, and ſo beare the true nature of the ſame, by which they appear to be holy by the fruits therof. Chriſt being the root or vine as aforeſaid, the branches can no way be ſaid to ſubſiſt and grow in him as their root but onely by faith, and hee in them by his Spirit, without which there is no holineſſe in the Apoſtles ſenſe, who ſpeaketh of ſuch an holineſſe as is produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the branch by the holy root, in which it ingrows, and ſo partakes of the nature of the root, by vertue of union and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion which it hath with the ſame.

So it is hereby the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall branches, they cannot properly bee called branches in the Apoſtles ſenſe, but as they partake of the life and grace of Chriſt, (their true vine and olive tree) by which they appeare (at the leaſt) to bee alive in him by faith, and enabled by the ſame to bring forth ſuch fruits as may diſcover them to bee in Covenant of grace, and ſo to be admitted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

And therefore hee admits not of any dead plants to be ſet in his ſpirituall vineyard, nor dead members to bee joyned in his myſticall body, but onely ſuch as are capable by faith to comply with the head. Neither tooke he for himſelf a compound body, conſiſting both of living and dead members, which all are that have not a living principle of grace and faith in him, which unbelievers have not, no nor all the Infants of believers, nor any at all, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they are born again of the Spirit, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.5, 6.

                  <q>That which you ſay,<note place="margin">Silvanus.</note> that the Jewes were the people of God in a twofold conſideration. Firſt, as a nationall people de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from the loynes of <hi>Abraham</hi> by naturall generation according to the fleſh. Secondly, ſome of them owned in a more ſpeciall manner with reference to his gracious Covenant, made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and eſtabliſhed with <hi>Iſaac,</hi> &amp;c.</q> This is not rightly ſpoken according to the tenor of Scripture language. For none of the Jews (much leſſe the whole Nation) was the people of God as they deſcended from the loynes of <hi>Abraham</hi> by Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall generation according to the fleſh, but onely with reference to his gracious Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and with his ſeed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him. If you ſet aſide the conſideration of the Covenant, the ſeed of the moſt holy of Gods Saints are children of wrath, and not a people of God.</p>
               <p>Neither let this ſeem to you of dangerous conſequence, that if God accounted the whole Nation of the Jewes to bee his people with reference to his gracious Covenant, then all the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt have been in a true and ſaving eſtate of grace, and ſo all of them either ſaved, or fallen from a ſtate of grace. For this conſequence will not follow, as hath been ſhewed above. But it is true that you ſay, that God did in a ſpeciall manner owne <hi>Iſaac</hi> and ſo all the elect ſeed, with whom he eſtabliſhed his Covenant, not ſo with <hi>Iſmael.</hi> And yet it may not be denyed, that God did eſtabliſh his Covenant to all the ſeed of <hi>Iſaac</hi> by <hi>Jacob,</hi> and that not onely to the elect ſeed, but to the whole Nation, till the ten Tribes rejected not onely the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> and the Worſhip of God in the Temple, (where God had put his name:) but alſo the Miniſtery of the Prophets whom God ſent to reclaime them, as afterwards the two Tribes of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin</hi> (commonly called the Jewes) rejected <hi>Davids</hi> Lord, the Lord Jeſus and his righteouſneſſe, and the Miniſtry of the Apoſtles. But before that rejection evident it is, that in the wilderneſſe God did by his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Covenant even eſtabliſh the whole Nationall poſterity of <hi>Jacob</hi> to be a people to himſelfe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.10, 11, 12, 13. And
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:113833:52"/> the Word uſed in the originall for the eſtabliſhing of the whole Nation to become Gods people (<hi>ver.</hi> 13.) is the very ſame which God uſed when he promiſed to eſtabliſh his Covenant with <hi>Iſaac, Gen.</hi> 17.19. And therefore it is not true which you ſay, That in <q>the naturall children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> God onely reſpected his cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen in Chriſt,</q> with whom he confirmed his Covenant with <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaac</hi> in reference to Chriſt. For the words of the Text doe plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſſe; that God by Covenant did confirme or eſtabliſh the whole houſe of <hi>Iacob</hi> to be a people to himſelfe, according to the Covenant which he had ſworn to <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob, Deut.</hi> 29.13. whence it was that (as the Apoſtle ſaith) to the Iſraelites (one and other) pertained the adoption, and the glory, and the Covenants, and the law, and the ſervice of God, and the promiſes, &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4. where he ſpeaketh of ſuch Iſraelites, as for whom he had great heavineſſe, and continuall ſorrow in his heart in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their unbelief, verſ. 2.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſſe, this I willingly grant you; that God had a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall reſpect to the elect and faithfull ſeed, as to whom hee reſerved the effectuall application of the ſpirituall and ſure mercies of the Covenant, though the externall diſpenſation of the Covenant, and of the ſeales of the Covenant, and of all the Ordinances of Gods worſhip was generally granted to all the ſeed, whether e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect or non-elect, faithfull or hypocrites. But to paſſe by your ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall diſcourſe of the ſtate of the people of the Jews in the Old Teſtament, let us attend to that which commeth nearer to the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument in hand, to wit, to the generall ſcope of the Apoſtles diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in the 11. Chapter of the Epiſtle to the Romans; which <q>you ſay is, concerning the breaking off of the Jewes, and the occaſion thereof, as alſo their calling by the Goſpel; wherein you tell me, the Apoſtle ever defends the faithfull ſeed of the Jews againſt the generall rejection of that Nation.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And it is true, he doth ſo in the former part of the chapter from <hi>ver.</hi> 1. to 10. but that is not his generall ſcope throughout the whole Chapter. For his general ſcope is to declare three things touching the rejection of the Jews.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that it is not univerſall, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. to 10. Secondly, that it is not unprofitable, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. Thirdly, that it is not irrecoverable, which he prophecyeth, proveth, and amplifyeth, <hi>v.</hi> 12. to the end of the Chapter. For the 1. That their rejection was not univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall, he proveth, firſt from his owne example, who was an Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:113833:52"/> 
                  <hi>ver.</hi> 1. 2. From Gods fore knowledge which is immutable, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. 3. From the like reſervation, which God made of a rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, in the dayes of <hi>Elijah, ver.</hi> 3, 4, 5, 6. And this reſerving of a remnant he amplifieth by the cauſe, the election of grace, <hi>ver.</hi> 5, 6. And by the contrary, the rejection of the reſt, which he proveth by the teſtimony of <hi>Iſay</hi> 7.8. alſo of <hi>David, ver.</hi> 9, 10. And thus farre he defendeth the faithfull ſeed of the Jewes againſt the generall rejection of that Nation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He proveth that their rejection is not unprofitable, by giving an inſtance, in an unſpeakable bleſſing, which thereby redounded unto the Gentiles, to wit, the ſalvation of the Gentiles, <hi>ver.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That their rejection is not irrecoverable or finall, but on the contrary, that their reſtoring and converſion is to be expected,</p>
               <p>He proveth firſt, from the great benefit which hee prophecyeth ſhall thereby redound to the Gentile-churches, which will be our riches and fulneſſe, and as it were our life from the dead. And that he proveth by an argument from the leſſe, <hi>ver.</hi> 12, 15.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he proveth their converſion is to bee expected by the end of his owne Miniſtery, which he profeſſeth to bee to ſave the Gentiles, for this end, that ſo hee may provoke the Jewes to the emulation of the Gentiles in receiving of the Goſpel, and by that meanes ſave ſome of them, <hi>ver.</hi> 13, 14. and thereby alſo bring on a greater increaſe of light and life to the Gentiles, <hi>ver.</hi> 15.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he proveth their rejection is not irrecoverable, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that there is certain ground of their converſion from the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of their Anceſtors, which deriveth in like ſort holineſſe to them, as the firſt fruits being holy, derive holineſſe (by Gods inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution) to the whole lump; and the root being holy, deriveth ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe (by Gods Covenant) to the branches, <hi>ver.</hi> 16.</p>
               <p>Whereupon, by the way he inſerteth a grave admonition to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to beware of boaſting, either againſt the Jewes for their Apoſtaſie, or within themſelves for their owne ſtability in the ſaith. For the Holy Ghoſt did foreſee that the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> (above all the Churches of the Gentiles) would bee moſt forward to boaſt of their infallibility and ſtability in the faith, by reaſon of the promiſe pretended to be made to <hi>Peters</hi> Chaire, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all the promiſes made to <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> of old; which boaſting, the Apoſtle repreſſeth, 1. By calling them to conſider their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſtate, they were branches of the olive tree wilde by nature, <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. 2. By putting them in minde they received the Goſpel
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:113833:53"/> from the Iewes, not the Iewes from them, thou beareſt not the root, but the root thee, <hi>v.</hi> 18.3. By the greater danger or poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of apoſtaſie and rejection of the Romans, then of the Iewes: for if God ſpared not the naturall branches (to wit, the Iewes) take heed leſt he alſo ſpare not thee, <hi>v.</hi> 19. to 22. 4. He both together repreſſeth the Arrogancy of the Romans, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all proveth that the Rejection of the Iewes is not irrecoverable, but their converſion more hopefull, then the converſion of the Romans was, by an Argument taken both from Gods power, <hi>v.</hi> 23. and alſo from the naturall eſtate of the branches, <hi>v.</hi> 24. which maketh their converſion more eaſy, If thou Roman wert cut off the Olive Tree, which is wild by nature, and wert (by a power above nature) graffed contrary to nature into a good Olive Tree: how much more ſhall theſe which be naturall Branches, bee graffed into their owne Olive Tree? 5. He Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth the ſame Arrogancy of the Romans, and with all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the converſion of the Iewes, by a word of prophecy both by his owne Teſtimony, <hi>v.</hi> 25. and by the Teſtimony of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſay, v.</hi> 26, 27.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Hee proſecuteth the ſame concluſion of the converſion of the Jewes, and demonſtration, that their rejection is not ſmall, and irrecoverable, by an argument taken from the immutability of Gods electing love to the children of ſuch, whoſe fathers he hath given an effectuall calling unto, in the fellowſhip of his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace, <hi>v.</hi> 28, 29.</p>
               <p n="7">7 He proveth and amplifieth the ſame by an argument <hi>à Pari,</hi> from equalls, thus, As you when you were unbeleivers have now obtained mercy through their unbeleife: ſo they now not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiving ſhall obtaine mercy through your mercy, <hi>v.</hi> 30, 31, 32. Finally he concludeth all with an holy and Affectionate Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the depth of the riches of the knowledge and wiſedome of God in theſe his unſearchable Iudgements and wayes, <hi>v.</hi> 33. to 36.</p>
               <p>I have the more fully opened to you the Analyſis of this whole chapter, that you may the better diſcern both the true ſcope of the Apoſtle, and withall your owne fallacy in perverting the Apoſtes ſcope to ſuch a meaning as will not ſuite with his words. <q>For you ſo carry the Apoſtles ſcope, as if he wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended throughout all this diſcourſe to defend a remnant of faithfull Iewes againſt the generall Apoſtaſie and rejection of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:113833:53"/> that Nation.</q> And leſt it might appeare that the Apoſtle had a principall ayme in the latter halfe of the chapter, to prove (as he evidently doth) the converſion and reſtoring of the Nation from the ſtate of Apoſtaſie and infidelity unto the Faith of Chriſt, and his Goſpell, you would have the Apoſtle underſtood to ſpeake of the Iewes in a ſtate of faith and holineſſe, and the whole lumpe of them to be holy by faith, as their firſt fruits <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob.</hi> And leſt it ſhould be thought that God will convert and reſtore the Iewes (as ſome of the Apoſtles Arguments carry it) out of reſpect to his Covenant with their holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors <hi>Abraham, Iſaaoc,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> (out of whom they deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as branches out of a root) you would have the root not to be meant, their holy Anceſtors, but Chriſt: and themſelves to be holy not by vertue of any Covenant of God with their Anceſtors, (for that you ſee would fetch in Infants, and others of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall ſeede within the bounds and benefit of the Covenant) but by vertue of their actuall Union and Communion with Chriſt through faith in his Name. And leſt it ſhould be humbled at (as juſtly it might) why the Apoſtle ſhould ſpend ſo many Arguments to prove the reſtoring and ingraffing of the Iewes into Chriſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

Such hard ſhifts the wits of men will make to ſeek any evaſions to avoid the light and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the truth of the word, when it will not ſtand with their owne foreſtalled imaginations. But let us conſider how you goe about to make theſe imaginations of your owne, to ſtand with the Apoſtles words. <q>The lumpe (ſay you) generally conſidered comprehendeth all both the firſt fruits and the latter: for except the firſt fruits were part of the lump, it could not give Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony that the whole lump was holy, which lump ſo conſidered is Gods elect in Chriſt with reference to their beleivin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Where 1. It may be marvelled why you ſhould make the holy
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:113833:54"/> Anceſtors of the Jewes, <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> the firſt fruits of the Jewes: and yet not make them in like ſort, the roote alſo. For the Apoſtle putteth no difference between the firſt fruits and the Roote, but ſpeaketh of them as two ſimilies to expreſſe one and the ſame thing: If the firſt fruits be holy, ſo is the whole lumpe; If the roote be holy, ſo are the branches, <hi>v.</hi> 16. And as Chriſt is in ſome other places of Scripture called a Roote, ſo is he alſo called the firſt fruits, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.20, 23. And ſure hee hath the firſt preheminence in all relations of holineſſe and grace unto his people. But let your interpretation ſtand ſo farre; let the firſt fruits of the lumpe of the Jewes be the holy Anceſtors of the Jewes, that is indeed the true meaning of the Apoſtle here; onely conſider if you can ſee any cauſe why you ſhould not as well take them in like ſort for the root alſo.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Why ſhould you make the firſt fruits part of the lump, more then the root part of the branches? As the firſt fruits bee to the lumpe; ſo is the root to the branches. The root is not part of the branches, though they be both part of the tree: No more are the firſt fruits part of the lumpe, though they bee both parts of the fruits of the field: The firſt fruits are ripe before the reſt of the fruits of the field: and being firſt reaped and preſenced <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               <p>Beſides, the firſt fruits did not give teſtimony that the lumpe was holy, (their hallowing of the lumpe was not by way of teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, or as one part of an Homogeneall body giveth teſtimony of the whole, as one cup of good wine out of a veſſell giveth te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, that all the wine in that veſſell is good) but by way of a morall inſtrumentall efficient cauſe: God accepting the firſt fruits of the field, given to himſelfe as holy; he therefore alloweth to the owner an holy uſe of the whole lumpe of the fruits of his field.</p>

                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:113833:54"/>3. Take that for granted (which is in it ſelfe not much materiall) that the firſt fruits were part of the lumpe: what will follow thereupon? <q>Why then (ſaith the Author) as thoſe firſt fruits of that bleſſed crop in Gods holy Covenant were holy by faith, and ſo appeared: ſo is the lumpe out of which theſe firſt fruits appeared by faith, as part of the ſame, holy alſo in the ſame conſideration. For this muſt reſpect a viſible holineſſe ſuitable to that of the firſt fruits: otherwiſe it maketh nothing to the thing in hand.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But how can this collection ariſe out of this compariſon of the firſt fruits? The firſt fruits of the field were viſibly preſented to the Lord in his Sanctuary, and being viſibly accepted, appeared viſibly to be holy. But as for the lumpe of the fruits of the field, there was no viſible appearance, either of their preſentation in the Sanctuary before the Lord, or of the Lords viſible acceptance of them, but onely in their firſt fruits. And ſo indeed it is here, the firſt fruits of Gods holy Covenant, <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing holy by faith, and accepted of God as holy to himſelfe, they viſibly appeared ſo to be. And through their holineſſe, and Gods acceptance of them, and of their ſeed in his holy Covenant, the lumpe of their poſterity from their infancy upward, were holy alſo, though they did not appeare in viſible holineſſe, till in ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of time they came to be preſented before the Lord in his Temple. And neither then did they appeare viſibly holy by their owne faith, but by the faith of their Parents preſenting them to the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>But (ſay you) if there be not a viſible holineſſe in the lumpe ſuitable to that in the firſt fruits, it maketh nothing for the thing in hand.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I willingly grant you that the Apoſtles intendment here, is to prove the converſion of the Jewes not onely to a relative holineſs ſuitable to the holineſſe that was in the firſt fruits their Anceſtors of old, which was viſible in their Fathers, and credible in their Infants by vertue of the Covenant, and viſible ſeale of it. But herein you commit a double prevarication in your plea: 1. That you will not allow ſuch an holineſſe to be found in the Jewes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they ſhall come to be converted, as is ſuitable unto the holineſſe of their Anceſtors.

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:113833:55"/> converſion of the Jewes unto holineſſe from the holy Covenant of their Anceſtors, and ſo would make the holineſſe of their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors a meanes to derive holineſſe to them, you would utterly make void the force of that argument. For the Apoſtles argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment proceedeth from the vertue of the firſt fruits by Gods inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution to ſanctifie the whole lumpe; but you will admit no ſuch vertue or efficacy by Gods inſtitution in the holy Covenant of their Anceſtors, as to derive holineſſe to their poſterity, which is to make the Apoſtles argument and compariſon of none effect.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This let me further adde, that whereas you in this diſcourſe of the firſt fruits and lump ſpeake of the Jewes to bee converted, as but a remnant: The Apoſtle declareth himſelfe to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that then all Iſrael ſhall be ſaved, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.26. Yea, not onely a body of the Jewes, but of the ten Tribes alſo, all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to what <hi>Ezekiel</hi> had prophecyed of old, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.16. to 22. And indeed, when the Apoſtle calleth the converſion of <hi>Iſrael</hi> a myſtery, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 11.25.) he giveth us to expect a more generall converſion of them, then of a remnant. The Apoſtle in like ſort called the converſion of the Gentiles a myſtery, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. And a myſtery (and hidden ſecret) indeed it was to the Jews of old; and yet it was never a myſtery to them the converſion of a remnant, or of a ſprinkling of the Gentiles, but the comming in of ſuch a great body and multitude of the Gentiles, that was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a myſtery to them. And ſo is the converſion of the Jewes a myſtery now unto the Gentiles, not the converſion of a remnant, but of ſo great a multitude and body of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as have been ſcattered like dry dead bones (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.) that indeed ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be a myſtery like the reſurrection from the dead, whereto the Apoſtle reſembleth it.</p>
               <p>To proceed to the other compariſon of the Apoſtle which was taken from the holineſſe of the root conveying holineſſe to the branches, to prove the converſion of the Jewes to holineſſe from the holineſſe of their Anceſtors.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Whereto your Author anſwereth. By root is meant not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believing Parents, and ſo the ſame with firſt fruits, but Chriſt myſtically conſidered with reference to rules of Order, Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and Government of his Church laid downe in the New Teſtament. In which reſpect he is called a vine, a root, and foundation.</q>
               </p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:113833:55"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I know no reaſon why the root in this Text ſhould bee meant not onely their believing parents (their holy Anceſtors) but Chriſt alſo, as hath been touched afore. Onely it ſeemeth you were afraid, that if believing Parents, or holy Anceſtors were brought in, as any means of the converſion of their poſterity un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to faith and holineſſe, it would eſtabliſh the vertue and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Covenant of grace from Parents to children, now in the dayes of the New Teſtament; the which you carefully ſhun. And therefore though you cannot but ſee, that the firſt fruits, and the root are uſed and applyed in one and the ſame ſenſe, and to the ſame purpoſe, and ſo are forced to confeſs, that as by the firſt fruits, ſo by the root is meant believing Parents; yet you will have the root to be meant, not onely believing Parents, but Chriſt: and indeed you bring ſuch arguments for Chriſt, as doe ſeeme to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain it wholly to Chriſt, and (in a manner) to exclude believing Parents. But all in vaine; for neither will your Arguments e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, Chriſt to be here expreſly intended by the Apoſtle, (but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by conſequence) neither will we deny that Chriſt, and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with Chriſt is intended in their fellowſhip with the root, though by the root bee here expreſly meant their holy Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors.</p>
               <p>It is true, Chriſt is called in Scripture phraſe, the vine, the root, the foundation, and ſo indeed he is primarily and eminently. But nevertheleſſe, the Church alſo is called a vine, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80, 8. And <hi>Abraham</hi> called a root, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.10. and the rock out of which the houſe of Iſrael was hewed, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 51.1. And the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles are called foundations, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.20. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.14. yea, every righteous man is called an everlaſting foundation, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.25. And therefore it is not the name of a root, that will caſt the root to be here meant of Chriſt, and not of <hi>Abraham.</hi>

                  </gap>, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.10. It is his meaning to threaten the Jewes, that God is about to cut them off from the Covenant of their father <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> of whom they were the off-ſpring and the branches. And thereby he confirmeth his admonition to them in the former verſe,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:113833:56"/> (<hi>verſ.</hi> 9.) thinke not (ſaith hee) to ſay with your ſelves, wee have <hi>Abraham</hi> to our Father, for God is able even of theſe ſtones (and ſo of ſtony hearted Gentiles) to raiſe up children unto <hi>Abraham.</hi> And leſt they might object, that themſelves were the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> rooted in him not onely by naturall generation, but by an everlaſting Covenant, he ſtrengtheneth his admonition with this threatening, <hi>verſe</hi> 10. Now is the Axe laid to the root of the trees, (to wit, to cut off barren branches from the Covenant of <hi>Abraham:</hi>) every tree therefore that bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewen downe, and caſt into the fire. And therefore it is proper enough (according to Scripture phraſe) to interpret the root to be meant of <hi>Abraham;</hi> and ſurely as fitly in this place of <hi>Paul,</hi> as in that of <hi>Matthew;</hi> but whether more proper, wee ſhall ſee anon.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſay you, it appeareth, Chriſt here to bee meant the root, <q>in that the Apoſtle chargeth the Gentiles, that if they boaſt in themſelves againſt the Jewes; Thou beareſt not the root, but the root thee, <hi>v.</hi> 18. that is, ſay you, thou appeareſt not to have the truth of grace, and ſo not to have the true na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the root and life of Chriſt in thy heart, but onely an outward form of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This interpretation the words of the Text will not bear; for if this were the meaning of the Apoſtles words, <q>Thou beareſt not the root, but the root thee; that is, thou appeareſt not to have the truth of grace, and ſo not the true nature of the root, and life of Chriſt in thine heart:</q> Then it will follow, that if the Gentiles did not boaſt, but had indeed the truth of grace, and life of Chriſt in their hearts, then it might be ſaid to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, the root beareth not thee, but thou beareſt the root: which is indeed contrary to the truth of Religion, yea, to the principles of grace. The abſurdity of this interpretation may give good light to ſhew, that indeed Chriſt is not properly meant to bee the root here ſpoken of. For if Chriſt were here intended to bee the Root, the Apoſtle would not apply this as a check to the arrogan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the boaſting Gentile, the root beareth thee. For it is no check, but a comfort, yea, the greateſt comfort and ſafety of a true and humble believer, not ſo much that he beareth Chriſt, as that Chriſt beareth him. But take the Apoſtle to meane <hi>Abraham</hi> to be the root of the Jewes (as the context carryeth it) and then his admonition is grave and weighty againſt the arrogancy of the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:113833:56"/> boaſting Gentile. If ſome of the branches be broken off, and thou being a wilde olive tree, wer't graffed in among them (that is, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Jewes) boaſt not thy ſelf againſt the branches. But if thou boaſt, (take this for a check) thou beareſt not the root. Thou art not the ſtock or root into which they were engraffed, but theirs is the root, into which thou art engraffed. For ſalvation is of the Jews (<hi>John</hi> 4.22.) thou receivedſt it from them, not they from thee: <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> as a mother bare <hi>Rome,</hi> not <hi>Rome, Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem. Abraham</hi> as a father by his faith, begot thee; as a root by his Covenant, he beareth thee, not thou him, nor the Church of his Covenant.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>But thirdly, you argue from the conſideration of that which the Jewes refuſed, and the Gentiles received, that it is Chriſt in his myſticall Order and Government amongſt his Saints, that is here the root and olive tree, who by h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The weakneſſe and fallacy of this Argument will eaſily appeare, if you caſt it into the forme of an argument, thus it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That which the Jews refuſed, and the Gentiles received, that is the root here ſpoken of, to wit, that root which being holy, the branches alſo are ſo too.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>But Chriſt myſtically conſidered, is that which the Jewes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, and the Gentiles received.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>And therefore Chriſt myſtically conſidered, is the root here ſpoken of, which being holy, the branches are alſo ſo too.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But here the Major or former Propoſition is juſtly denyed. For though Chriſt himſelfe be a root which the Jewes refuſed, and the Gentiles received, yet hee is not that root here intended, whoſe holineſſe inferreth and concludeth the converſion of the Jewes to holineſſe. But the Apoſtle here ſpeaketh of ſuch a root, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing holy, argueth that his branches, (though now broken off) will come on againe to holineſſe; which cannot bee argned from the holineſſe of Chriſt. For take Chriſt for the root, and will the Apoſtles Argument then follow; If Chriſt be holy, then the Jews (though now broken off) are, or ſhall be holy alſo? Is there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſoundneſſe in ſuch an inference? If you ſay, Nay, but all that you would infer from thence, is this, that if Chriſt the root bee holy, then the Jewes, when they ſhall come to bee graffed into
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:113833:57"/> him againe, they will be alſo holy: That is true indeed, and needs no proof. But that is not the Apoſtles ſcope, to ſhew that they ſhall be holy, when they are engraffed into Chriſt, but to prove that they ſhall be engraffed into Chriſt, and become holy becauſe their root is holy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which will indeed ſtrongly follow, by vertue of the Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed, if <hi>Abraham</hi> bee here taken for the root, but not ſo, if Chriſt: What then will you ſay? is <hi>Abraham</hi> better then <hi>Chriſt?</hi> Not ſo neither; but <hi>Christ</hi> doth more delight to communicate his grace, rather in the way of the Covenant of his grace, then out of it.</p>
               <p>Neither will it appeare (though you ſay it will) that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is here meant by the Apoſtle to be the root of the Jews, if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what was the Jews own naturall root and olive tree, <q>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they were naturall branches onely by faith; as the Apoſtle ſo declareth them, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is utterly untrue which you ſay, that the Jews were the <q>naturall branches of their owne naturall root, onely by faith, and that the Apoſtle ſo declareth them, <hi>v.</hi> 20, 21, 22.</q> For it is evident the Apoſtle expreſſely declareth the naturall branches not to be ſpared of God, but to be broken off for their unbeliefe, <hi>v.</hi> 19, 20, 21. And therefore unbeliefe was found in the naturall bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; and then they were not naturall branches onely by faith; for then no naturall branches could have been broken off. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could the naturall branches bee ſaid to bee graffed in againe, much more readily then the <hi>Romans, v.</hi> 24. for the <hi>Romans</hi> ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding by faith, had equally as ready acceſſe unto union and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his Ordinances, which you take to bee the root, as the Jewes when they ſhall bee converted to the faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>It is readily granted, and needed no proofe, that the Jewes of old enjoyed union and communion with <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaicall Ordinances of the Old Teſtament (whereof ſome were typicall, and ſome morall.) And it is a confeſſed truth alſo, that God changed the Order and manner of that Worſhip (but not the matter) in the New Teſtament. But that the Jewes were broken off for their oppoſing and rejecting that new or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:113833:57"/> is not ſafely ſpoken.</q> For they were broken off for reſiſting and oppoſing the righteouſneſſe of Faith in Chriſt Ieſus. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. which was no new order brought in by Chriſt in the New Teſtament, but was the principall matter of all their Typicall and Moſaicall Worſhip, which your ſelfe confeſſe was not changed. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides it cannot be denyed, That the faithfull and their ſeede was the ſubject matter of the Church, and ſo part of the Order of the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in the Old Teſtament. And this was neither Moſaicall nor Typicall, but before both. And if the matter of the worſhip bee not changed (though the manner be) then as the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and their (ſeede whether Iews or proſelyte Gentiles) were the ſubject matter of the Church, and a Morall part of church order of old, then are they ſo ſtill, and neither of them to be excluded.</p>
               <p>It was wholly needleſſe and impertinent to prove that the <q>Iews were caſt off from Communion with God in his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip for their unbeleife, and that the Gentiles who ſubmitted to the Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt are taken in, and doe ſtand in relation to God by Faith in him: And that the Iews when God ſhall pleaſe to call them by the Goſpell to beleive in his Son, they ſhall be received in againe to fellowſhip and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, with God in his ſervice as worſhip, as of old.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But take all this for granted, and yet it reacheth not neare the Apoſtles Words and diſcourſe in this chapter who proveth that the Iews ſhall be called in againe to Faith and Holineſſe, by reaſon of their relation as branches to their root. Which though they be broken off from it by their enmity againſt the the Goſpell; yet they ſtill belong to it, according to the Election of God, and according to his love which by his everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant he bare and promiſed to beare to their Fathers and to their ſeed after them throughout all Generations.</p>
               <p>To proceede then. As your diſcourſe of the roote hath not hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto proved Chriſt to be the roote: So neither will your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the Branches prove either Chriſt to be the root, or the Branches, to be ſuch, and can be no other then ſuch as doe ſubſiſt and grow in Chriſt onely by Faith. For 1. It hath beene (as I conceive) cleared already, that Chriſt is not the roote here meant by the Apoſtle: 2. If the branches be ſuch, and can be no other but ſuch, as doe ſubſiſt and grow in Chriſt one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Faith, how then came it to paſſe, that the branches were
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:113833:58"/> broken off? can ſuch as doe ſubſiſt in Chriſt (as in a roote) onely by Faith, can they be broken off? What is then become of Chriſts prayer for all that doe, or ſhall beleive on him? <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.20, 21, 22, 23, 24.</p>
               <p>But (ſay you) the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of ſuch branches as are in <q>him by faith and he in them by his ſpirit, without which (Faith and Spirit) there is no holineſſe in the Apoſtles ſenſe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> It is true, the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of ſuch an Holineſſe in the branches (<hi>v.</hi> 16.) as proceedeth from the Spirit and Faith: But that is an holyneſſe which is not found in all Branches (for then no branches ſhould be cut off, but which ſhall be found in the Iews at their converſion, as the Apoſtle proveth by reaſon of their relation to <hi>Abraham</hi> as their root, through the grace of his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. But will not prove, that there is no way for the branches to ſubſiſt in the root, but onely by Faith and Spirit. For, theſe branches who ſhall be converted to holineſſe, were in <hi>Abraham</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by Naturall Generation, and did pertaine to <hi>Abrahams</hi> Covenant by the grace of Election: by vertue of both which (both of the Election of grace, and of the Covenant of grace) they ſhall come at laſt to be converted to the fellowſhip of the Spirit, and of the faith of <hi>Abraham.</hi>

               <p>
                  <q>But 2. Say you, There is no branch that is alive in Chriſt, but partaketh of the ſap and life of Chriſt, and bringeth forth ſuch fruit, be they never ſo young and ſmall, whereby the ſame may bee diſcerned. So it is here by theſe ſpirituall branches, they cannot properly bee called branches in the Apoſtles ſenſe but as they partake of the life and Grace of Chriſt.</q>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> It is true, There is no branch alive in Chriſt, but partakes of the Sap and Life of Chriſt. But it is not true, <q>that every ſuch living branch in Chriſt (bee it never ſo young and ſmall) bringeth forth ſuch fruits whereby the ſame may be diſcerned.</q>
               </p>
               <p>For what diſcernible fruit of the life of Chriſt, did <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſhew forth, when he was ſanctified from his mothers wombe? <hi>Jer.</hi> 1.5. Yea, Chriſt himſelfe who was full of the ſpirit of life from his Mothers wombe, what diſcernible fruits thereof did hee bring forth? Doth the Goſpell and ſtory of his life expreſſe any? or can your ſelfe imagine any?</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Neither is it true that you ſay, that the ſpirituall branches can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

               </p>
               <p>For the Apoſtle doth not call them ſpirituall Branches, nor are they all ſuch, unleſſe by ſpirituall, you mean Metaphoricall.

And ſo is it here, God thinks it no bad husbandry in him, to admit dead plants to bee ſet and grow in his Vineyard, and if they grow fruitfull, well, if not, to tolerate them there, till they grow up to fulfill their iniquity (as hee did the Iews,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:113833:59"/> 
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.32.) becauſe then he knows how to illuſtrate the glory of his juſtice in caſting them into the fire of Hell, <hi>John</hi> 15.6. <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.10.</p>
               <p>It is true, which you ſay, Chriſt cometh not ſhort of Nature: but in this, he exceedeth Nature. Nature cannot make a dead plant ſet in a Vineyard, or graffed in a ſtock, to grow: But Chriſt can make a dead plant ſet in his Church to grow living and fruitful. For elſe how came <hi>John Baptiſts</hi> Miniſtry to turn the hearts of ſo many Publicans, ſouldiers, and other people to bring forth fruits meete for repentance? <hi>Luke</hi> 3.10. to 14. But otherwiſe, if Chriſt make not dead plants ſet in his Church to grow living and fruitfull, he can make them grow up to yeeld more fewell to the fire of his wrath, and to grow ripe for greater damnation. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23 14. <q>It is utterly therefore untrue which you ſay, that Chriſt admits not of any dead plants to be ſet in his Vineyard: or that he taketh not to himſelf a compounded body of living and dead members: or that the Church of God is not a mixt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany &amp;c.</q> For who called <hi>Iudas</hi> to the Apoſtleſhip? did not the Lord Jeſus himſelfe?

The Church of Chriſt is often in the Goſpell called the Kingdome of Heaven, and in <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.1. The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven is given for the ſtile of ſuch Churches, as are moſt pure, ſuch as they will bee after the deſtruction of Antichriſt, and the calling of the Jews prophecyed of in chapter 24. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all the members are virgins (none defiled with Antich<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The place in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.14. to 20. ſheweth what the Church of Gods Redeemed bee, and all the ſpirituall members thereof: but neither proveth that all the members of the Church are ſuch, or that the Infants of beleevers are not ſuch. The Church of God in <hi>Zion</hi> was built upon the foundation of the Prophets: and it was an habitation to the Lord. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.13. yet infants were members of it. The place in <hi>John</hi> 4.23. ſheweth (as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) what God ſeeketh: not that hee findeth all ſuch in every Church: much leſſe that hee excludeth Infants out of the Church, till they can make it appeare by open profeſſion of their faith, that they doe worſhip him in Spirit and truth. It hath bin proved above, that of Infants is the Kingdome of God (<hi>Mar.</hi> 10.14.)
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:113833:60"/> that is, the Church: and yet they cannot profeſſe and declare any ſuch worſhip in their owne Perſons: though indeed the Acts of their godly parents in that caſe are there accepted of Chriſt, as the Acts of the Infants.

                  <note place="margin">Silveſter.</note>There is a large difference betweene the Iews and Gentiles in reſpect of outward Priviledges. The Infants of the Iews had a ſpeciall reaſon for their admittance into the fellowſhip of the Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Church, <q>which doth not now continue in Chriſtian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. Of the Iews came Chriſt, the Saviour of man; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſalvation is ſaid to bee of the Iews, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.5. <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.22. In reſpect of which there was a bleſſed promiſe paſſed upon the Iews for the bringing forth of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and the promiſed ſeede, in whom all Nations ſhould be bleſſed. And therefore all of that Nation were admitted to the outward Priviledges, as figures of him whom that Nation was to bring forth. So that a fruitfull wombe was counted a great bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing among the Iews, as not knowing who might be ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, as to bring forth that bleſſed, and all bleſſing ſeede. And therefore God honoured the Naturall birth with ſuch outward bleſſings and priviledges, which belong not to the Gentiles at all.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Gentiles now are to looke for their bringing forth Chriſt according to the Spirit, as the Iews did then according to the fleſh: and likewiſe their birth: and their ſeed and all things ſuitable to the ſame, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.3.5, 6. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.12, 13. And therefore wee are ſaid now to know no man after the fleſh. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.16. And Circumciſion was one Priviledge of the fleſh, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.4, 5. Therefore though the Iews Infants were admitted to all thoſe outward Priviledges being a Nationall people, and ſo a Nationall body, with a naturall birth, and the like ſeede in generall: yet the Gentiles Infants cannot bee admitted to their ſpirituall priviledges, they being a perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall People called by the word of Grace, and ſo a ſpirituall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with a ſpirituall birth, and the like ſeed.</q>

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:113833:60"/> the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> being Gods firſt borne (<hi>Exod.</hi> 4.24.) and ſo our elder brother, they were the excellency of Dignity, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of power; glorious and mighty wonders, the Lord often wrought for them, they had the preheminence: of them was Chriſt, of them were the Fathers, (the Patriarchs and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets) and to them were committed the Oracles of God. And if you will ſo account it, a double portion to injoy, both a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregationall Church, and a Nationall, they injoyed both a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregationall Church in their Synagogues, and a National Church at Hieruſalem in their ſolemne feaſts.</p>
               <p>But two things let mee here put you in minde of: firſt, that when the Elder brother, for his demerit is diſinherited of his Birth-right (as <hi>Reuben</hi> ſometime was) his preheminence of honour and double portion is divided amongſt his younger brethren: no part of it is loſt. So is it here. The Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inherited, all the ſpirituall priviledges, all the honour and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which they injoyed either in their Synagogue, or in their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall Aſſemblies, is now ſet over to our Congregationall Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; and as for the outward Priviledges, which the houſe of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> injoyed (as a wordly Kingdome and the power and glory thereof) they were no part of the priviledges of their Church eſtate, but acceſſories and additaments thereunto. For in the Covenant of <hi>Abraham</hi> God ſpake nothing of a worldly king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but of affliction for 400. yeares, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.13. as therefore worldly power and glory, were caſt in as acceſſorie to the Church of the Old Teſtament, ſo they may be alſo in the New. If the Churches of the New Teſtament ſhall bind Kings in chaines, as is prophecyed <hi>Pſal.</hi> 140.8. and execute upon them the judgement written, then ſurely Chriſtian Churches ſhall have ſome Kings to bee members of their body, elſe what have they to doe to judge them that are without? the Apoſtle ſaith, Godlineſſe hath the promiſes of this life as well as of that which is to come, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. What though Church power bee not adminiſtred with worldly pompe? and what though all the children of the Church bee equall in Church-Priviledges? yet ſome or other of the children of the Church ate capable of great preheminence even in outward Priviledges: They may be Princes in all Lands, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.16. which though ſome underſtand of ſpirituall power, yet not ſo properly: for ſpiritual power is not princely in the earth. Beſides, if civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy be lawful amongſt men (which you deny not) ſome of the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:113833:61"/> children of the Church may bee as fitly employed in ſuch a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality, as Pagans. And ſurely the time ſhall come when accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the prophecy of <hi>Daniel</hi> (chapt. 7.27.) the Kingdome and the Dominion and the greatneſſe of the Kingdome under the whole heaven ſhall bee given to the people of the Saints of the moſt High.</p>
               <p>A ſecond thing which I would put you in minde of (which alſo hath been mentioned above) is that wee doe not ſtand upon Nationall Iewiſh priviledges, but upon the Covenant of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> which was given with the Seale thereof to him and his ſeed before any of the Jewes and Iſraelites were borne, when <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed were confidered rather as a Domeſticall Church, then a as national. And then the Covenant was given to him as walking before God in uprightneſſe of heart, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1.7. which cannot bee without faith; and the ſigne of the Covenant was given him as a ſigne and ſeale of the righteouſneſſe of Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. and both Covenant and ſeale were given to his infant ſeed for his faith ſake, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. And in caſe his infant ſeede ſhould grow up to riper yeares, and then not take hold of the Covenant of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> but prophanely reject, they were caſt out of their Church Eſtate, as was <hi>Iſmael,</hi> and <hi>Eſau.</hi> And ſo the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> could never grow up to a Nationall Church, unleſſe when they grew up to yeares, they ſhould continue in a viſible Profeſſion of the Faith of <hi>Abraham:</hi> or unleſſe god ſhould afterwards enlarge the wings of his Covenant to reach over the whole Nation, as hee began to doe in the Teſtament of <hi>Iacob, Gen.</hi> 49.26. and more fully and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnely declared the ſame, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.3. to 8. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.10. to 13. But it is not the Covenant of <hi>Jacob</hi> to him, and to all his Poſterity, during their lives, that wee plead for: But the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and bleſſing of <hi>Abraham:</hi> which the Apoſtle ſaith is co ue up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us Gentiles, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.14. which onely admitteth the faithfull and their infant ſeed, not during their lives, in caſe their lives ſhould grow up to Apoſtaſie, or open ſcandall: but during their infancy, and ſo long after as they ſhall continue in a viſible profeſſion of the Covenant, and faith, and the religion of their fathers; Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe if the children of the faithfull grow up to Apoſtaſie or to any open ſcandall, (as <hi>Iſmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> did) as they were then, ſo ſuch like now, are to be caſt out of the fellowſhip of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and of the ſeales thereof. But you willingly take no notice here of the Covenant of <hi>Abraham</hi> to him and to his ſeed. And
<pb n="710" facs="tcp:113833:61"/> becauſe ſay you, <q>the Jews had a promiſe for the bringing forth the <hi>Meſſias</hi> the promiſed ſeed in whom all Nations ſhould bee bleſſed, therefore all of that Nation were admitted to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Priviledges, as figures of him whom that Nation was to bring forth: which made a fruitfull wombe accounted ſo great a bleſſing among the Jewes, as not knowing who might bee ſo far honoured as to bring forth that bleſſed ſeed.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But Chriſt came of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and of <hi>Iſaae,</hi> as well as of <hi>Judah</hi> (the father of the Jews:) and yet that did not admit all the Nations which ſprang of them to the outward Priviledges, as you call them (though very abſurdly (if you meane (as you ſeeme to doe) the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and the ſeale thereof.

               <p>Beſides, many Tribes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were admitted (they and their ſeed) to the Priviledge of the Covenant, and to the ſeale thereof, of whom yet it was evident, that Chriſt was not to ſpring of any of of them. The Iewes who deſcended all of them of <hi>Iudah,</hi> they were but one tribe of twelve. And why ſhould all the other eleven Tribes bee circumciſed as well as the Jews, in reſpect of their bringing forth their promiſed ſeed, when yet old <hi>Jacob</hi> had limited the bringing forth of the <hi>Meſſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>h</hi> to the Tribe of <hi>Judah? Gen.</hi> 49.10. Were all the children of the eleven Tribes figures of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> as well as the children of the Jews? Beſides, in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> time, there was a promiſe given to him, that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhould come out of his loynes, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. Why then ſhould any other families of the Jews injoy ſuch a Priviledge that all their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants ſhuold bee circumciſed with the Seale of the Covenant? Doth any word of Scripture make all the Infants of all the Jews, yea of all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> figures of the <hi>Meſſiah?</hi> And if no word of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo doe, ſhall any man forge ſuch an imagination of his owne braine, and be guiltleſſe? what though a fruitfull wombe was counted a great bleſſing among the Jews? So it was alſo among the other Tribes, who yet could not expect the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> to ſpring from them. It was a cauſe juſt enough to account a fruitfull wombe a great bleſſing, not onely becauſe it was a bleſſing to the family, but alſo becauſe it was an inlargement of the Church. In which reſpect the Elders and Peoples of Bethlehem bleſſed <hi>Ruth (Chap.</hi> 4.11.) and <hi>Boaz</hi> with her, The Lord make this young Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,

               </p>
               <p>How will you make it appeare, That God honoured the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall birth among the Jews, <q>with ſuch outward bleſſings and Priviledges that belongs not to the Gentiles at all?</q>
               </p>
               <p>You ſhould have done well to have told us, what thoſe outward bleſſings and Priviledges were: and to have cleared it, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the Jews and not to the Gentiles at all. Otherwiſe it will not bee ſafe for you to take up doctrines of Religion upon truſt of mans word.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Gentiles (ſay you) are now to looke for our bringing forth of Chriſt according to the Spirit, as the Jews did then according to the fleſh; and likewiſe their birth and ſeed, and all things ſuitable to the ſame, as <hi>John</hi> 3.3.5.6. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.12, 13. And therefore wee are ſaid to know no man now, no not Chriſt himſelfe after the fleſh, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.16. And Circumciſion was one Priviledge of the fleſh, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.4, 5.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> It is not true, that all the Jewes did looke to bring forth Chriſt according to the fleſh. For in <hi>Davids</hi> time, they knew, that Priviledge was peculiar to his family, neither is it true, that the Gentiles are now to look for the bringing forth of Chriſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Spirit, any more then the Jews were to looke then. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> maketh us equall with the Jews, and them with us in this Priviledge: Wee looke (ſaith hee) to bee ſaved through the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, even as they, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.11. It behoved them as well as us, to attaine a ſpirituall birth and to bee borne of an immortall ſeed ſuitable to the ſame, as well as us; for it was not to a Gentile, but to <hi>Nicodemus</hi> a Jew, that Chriſt ſpake un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.3.5, 6. Except a man be borne againe of water, and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God. That which is borne of the fleſh is fleſh: that which is borne of the Spirit is Spirit; Where it doth not appeare that Chriſt ſpake to <hi>Nicodemus</hi> of entring into the viſible Church, for Chriſt did not ſeek to gather a viſible church ſeparate from the Church of the Jews till after his aſcenſion. But he ſpake to him of entrance into the Kingdome of Glory, and ſuch a ſtate of ſalvation in the Kingdome of Grace, as onely regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate perſons did attaine unto, whether Jews or Chriſtians. Chriſt would never have called <hi>Iudas</hi> to Office in his Church (which is the place of an emiment member) if none could enter into the viſible Church, but regenerate perſons. Your other place

For all the words of the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt <hi>Iohn,</hi> from <hi>v.</hi> 1. to 14 are a deſcription of Chriſt. 1. What hee was from eternity, <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2. 2. What hee was in the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>v.</hi> 3, 4. 3. What hee did to men after the fall, <hi>v.</hi> 5. &amp;c. 4. What hee did to the world of Pagans by his workes of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and Providence. <hi>v.</hi> 9, 10. 5. How hee came to his owne people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in his Ordinances, <hi>v.</hi> 11. And yet many of them received him not, to wit, by faith in ſincerity and truth. <hi>v.</hi> 11. But thoſe that did receive him; that is, beleeve in him; to them hee gave power or priviledge, not to bee called, but to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his ſons, <hi>v.</hi> 12. And theſe were borne, to wit, borne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, not by power of Nature, but by the grace of God, <hi>v.</hi> 13. Then it followeth, the Word became fleſh, <hi>v.</hi> 14. So that it may appeare plainly by the Context, that <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeaketh not of the eſtate of the people of the New Teſtament, before they can enter into the viſible Church, but of the ſpirituall eſtate of all the beleeving Saints of the Old Teſtament. The other place in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.16. wee have opened it above. Wee now know no man after the fleſh, no not Chriſt himſelfe now. In which words it is no part of the Apoſtles ſcope or meaning to ſet forth what qualifications are to bee attended to in addmitting members into the viſible Church, but to direct Church-members and all Chriſtians, not to eſteeme of themſelves &amp; others according to common gifts and carnall excellencies, and outward Priviledges (wherein the falſe Apoſtles gloryed, <hi>v.</hi> 12.) but to live as thoſe who have fellowſhip with Chriſt in his death and reſurrection, and therefore not to live unto our ſelves, or to this world, but unto Chriſt, <hi>v.</hi> 14, 15. And leſt it ſhould bee objected, Why, time hath beene when you <hi>(Paul)</hi> your ſelfe have gloryed in carnall excellencies and Jewiſh Priviledges, yea and have eſteemed meanly of Chriſt himſelfe for his poverty ſake, and becauſe hee was rejected of the high Prieſts and Elders: <hi>Paul</hi> anſwereth, though we have known Chriſt after the fleſh, that is, though wee have eſteemed meanly of him, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his meane outſide; yet now henceforth wee neither know or acknowledge him, or any man elſe according to the fleſh. Where by knowing no man after the fleſh, he doth not meane that bee now knoweth no ſeed of the faithfull to have any Priviledge

               <p>There is indeed an holineſſe of the fleſh, that is oppoſite to the uncleanneſſe of the fleſh: but there is no holineſſe of the fleſh,<note place="margin">Silvanus.</note> that proceedeth from marriage; For though an unlawfull marriage may pollute both fleſh and Spirit, yet a lawfull marriage doth not make either of them holy: In that place of <hi>Ezra</hi> the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of the Jews with ſtrangers was an uncleane and an unholy marriage, as polluting the Covenant of their God, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.11. Yet that marriage of the Jews with their owne Nation did not make them holy: much leſſe did the marriage of ſtrangers with ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:113833:64"/> make them holy, though their marriage was lawfull. Though nothing that is holy is uncleane: yet all things that are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane, are not forthwith holy. For not onely that which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy is uncleane, but alſo that which is unrighteous, or any way unlawfull, is uncleane alſo. Stollen goods are uncleane: but yet goods well gotten, are not holy. The oppoſition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that is betweene uncleanneſſe and holineſſe, is not that oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition which is betweene immediate contraries, that whatſoever is not uncleane, the ſame ſhould bee holy: or as if it were enough to make a thing holy, becauſe it is not uncleane; Or as if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the marriage of the Jews with the ſtrangers was uncleane, and their ſeed uncleane and accurſed, therefore their marriage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves was holy. It is true, marriage is honourable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all, and in regard of Gods inſtitution, holy: It is true alſo, that the ſeed which the Iews had in a way of lawful marriage were called an holy ſeed. <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.2. But yet that holineſſe of their ſeed, did not proceed from the holineſſe of their marriage: (for then to this day the children of married Iews were an holy ſeed ſtil) but from the holineſſe of the Covenant between God, &amp; them.</p>
               <p>The next place you referre mee to is in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.4, 5. where it is ſaid that <hi>Davids</hi> young men having beene kept from women three dayes, their veſſels were holy.

Or did it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in their Legitimation? No verily; it rather ſprung from their want of uſe of lawfull marriage: in that they had not kept com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with their wives of three dayes. For it is not to be thought that <hi>David</hi> would keepe his men to keepe company with Harlots.

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:113833:64"/> that there is a contrary holineſſe of the fleſh, when a man poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeth his Veſſell in Sanctification and Honour, both theſe are truths, but nothing to your purpoſe. For this holineſſe of the fleſh, is alſo an holineſſe of the ſpirit.

And this holineſſe is a part of that latter holines; (whereof you ſpake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) to wit, that holy frame of Gods workmanſhip in the heart by the holy ſpirit of regeneration, which giveth right to the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges. And therefore you will not allow this kinde holineſſe to be meant in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. for then by the lawfulneſſe of the Parents mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, children ſhould be freed from the luſt of Concupiſcence, and inabled to poſſeſſe their veſſels in ſanctification and honour.</p>
               <p>That other place which you put in (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1, 2.) I know not to what end you alledge it, unleſſe it bee to prove, that marriage in times of perſecution, is not expedient, (which is the meaning of the firſt verſe:) or that fornication is to bee avoided by lawfull marriage, which is the intent of the ſecond verſe: But what is either of theſe to the point in hand?</p>
               <p>To returne therefore to the point, from whence your objection diverted mee, it ſtill remaineth good, that the holineſſe of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſpoken of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. doth not proceed from the holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of marriage, but from the holy Covenant of grace.</p>
               <p>Which may further bee confirmed from the very word of the Text. For the Apoſtle deriveth that holineſſe of Infants, not from the holy Ordinance of marriage, but from the faith of the beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Parent whereby both the unbeleeving yoak-follow is ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to the beleever, and the children alſo of the beleever are holy.</p>
               <p>I thinke both alike, the children are no otherwiſe holy by the ſaith of the beleeving Parent,<note place="margin">Silveſter.</note> then the unbeleeving yoake-fellow is ſanctified to the beleever. That is to ſay, the beleever hath a ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied uſe of Cohabitation and Communion with them both. For to the pure all things are pure, but to the unbeleever nothing is pure. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15. So that whereas before both the yoake-fellows were uncleane by Idolatry, and their children alſo: now by the converſion of one of the yoak-fellows to the faith, though hee might ſcruple the lawfulneſſe of his cohabitation and Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, either with his yoak-fellow, or with his children: Yet the Apoſtle telleth him, hee needeth not ſo to doe. For by his
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:113833:65"/> faith, both his yoak-fellow and children alſo are ſanctified to him, hee hath an holy uſe to them both. In the ſame ſenſe are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſaid to bee holy, and the unbeleeving yoak-fellow ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For I have learned it from ſome men skilful in the tongues, that it is the ſame word, or at leaſt derived from the ſame root and theame, whereby the unbeleever is ſaid to bee ſanctified, and the children ſaid to be holy.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Silvanus.</note>It is true indeed, the one of the words is derived from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: But yet the Apoſtle uſeth them here in ſuch a different phraſe, or manner of ſpeach, as putteth a manifeſt difference in the ſenſe, and ſignification of them. For when hee ſaith, the unbeleeving yoak-fellow is ſanctified, hee doth not leave it ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a limitation or reſtriction, but ſaith, hee or ſhee is ſanctified in the beleever, or to the beleever, and that limiteth the ſenſe, to the beleevers uſe. But when hee ſpeaketh of children, hee doth not ſpeake with ſuch limitation, they are holy to the beleever, but poſitively, they are holy. Now the difference is manifeſt and great betwene theſe two, to bee ſanctified to a beleever and to bee holy: for example. It may truely bee ſaid, all afflictions and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution it ſelfe, are ſanctified to a beleever: but it cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bee ſaid, that affliction, yea perſecution is holy, yea, wee may bee bold to ſay, that even the falls of Gods children are ſanctified unto them, I meane their falls into ſinne: yet wee may not ſay, that their falls into ſinne, are holy. No ſcripture language allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth any thing to bee called holy, but that which is holy, either by imputation from Chriſt, or regeneration from the Spirit, or ſeparation unto God, from uncleanneſſe to his holy worſhip. Search the Scripture, you will not finde it otherwiſe, neither is it otherwiſe in this place. For elſe the Apoſtle might as well have ſaid thus; The children by the unbeleeving wife, are ſanctified in the beleeving husband: and the children by the unbeleeving hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, are ſanctified in the beleeving wife, elſe were your unbeleeving yoak-fellows uncleane: but now they are holy. But do you thinke the holy Spirit of God would ever call infidells &amp; Idolaters holy? But ſuppoſe, (as ſome of your books would have it) that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle did acknowledge unbeleeving yoak-fellowes to bee holy, is there not then a two-fold holineſſe mentioned in the Text: the one, not in the thing it ſelf, but to anothers uſe: the other of the thing in it ſelfe: Is it not then ſinne to confound theſe two for all one which God hath diſtinguiſhed?</p>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:113833:65"/>
               <p>I deny not but this is true in a part,<note place="margin">Silveſter.</note> that there is twofold holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe here ſpoken of. For the holineſſe of the children is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch a relative holineſſe, <q>as to one anothers uſe (as the unbeleever to the beleevers uſe and no more:) but the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of children reſteth in themſelves as the ſubjects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by nature, being begotten and borne in that lawfull &amp; hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable way of marriage by Gods appointment, and ſo holy &amp; cleane in oppoſition to ſuch as are begotten and brought forth in a way of uncleanneſſe, as adultery, fornication, and the like.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This kinde of holineſſe which you ſpeake of,<note place="margin">Silvanus.</note> reſting in the children by being begotten and borne in that lawfull and honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able way of marriage, hath beene refuted above. The Scripture acknowledgeth no ſuch holineſſe, as proceedeth from lawfull and honourable marriage. If there were ſuch an holneſſe, the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of married infidels were holy as well, as the children of Chriſtians. But the Apoſtle here ſpeaketh of ſuch an holineſſe, as would not bee found in children, unleſſe one of the Parents at leaſt were a beleever; to ſpeake of holineſſe ſince the fall in chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, whereof they are ſubjects by nature, is ſtrange language in Chriſtian eares; you might as well ſpeak of prophanenes of grace, as of holineſſe by nature. The holy Ghoſt is the proper ſubject of holineſſe: and the proper cauſe of all holineſſe in the creature: ſo that nothing ought to bee called holy, but what hee either maketh, or calleth holy. But it will never bee found, that the holy Ghoſt ever imparted either the nature or name of holineſſe to any, becauſe they were begotten in lawfull marriage, and not in whoredome. Beſides if this were the meaning of the Apoſtle, to prove that beleevers might lawfully keepe their unbeleeving yoak-fellowes, becauſe the children which they had by them were begotten in lawfull marriage, the Apoſtle had not thereby cleared nor removed the ſcruple of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> but rather aggravated it. For they might as juſtly doubt of their lawfull cohabitation with their children, as with their infidell wives. The ſame grounds which puts them to ſcruple the one, did as juſtly move them to ſcruple the other: ſo that to expound the Apoſtle this way, doth not cleare the ſcruple but rather double is.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>It ſeemeth to mee otherwiſe to expound the Apoſtle this way,<note place="margin">Silveſter.</note> is the onely way for the clearing of the ſcruple of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians:</hi> which befell them by reaſon of an Epiſtle, which the Apoſtle wrote to them before in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.9. where he ſo preſſed
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:113833:66"/> them from having any Communion or fellowſhip with any uncleane perſon in the worſhip of God, that they underſtood him to condemne alſo civill commerce with the world, upon which they queſtioned the lawfull retaining of their unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving husbands and wives, and to have communion with them in Society. And ſo much the more, as having an example of the like nature in the law, <hi>Ezsa.</hi> 10.7. About which thing, &amp; that neare relation of husband and wife in their civil commerce they wrote to the Apoſtle for information, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. And queſtioned not their children. Whereby it appeareth, they held it lawfull to retaine their children. To which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle anſwereth from a double ground thus.</q>

               <p>Whether the ſcruple of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> about cohabitation with their unbeleeving yoak-fellowes, did ariſe from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles former letter, or not, it is not plainly expreſſed in the Text: But of the two, it may be gathered from the Text, rather not, then yes: For if their ſcruple had riſen from the Apoſtles former advice, not to keepe company with Fornicators (whether bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or ſpirituall) hee had fully anſwered that ſcruple before in the fifth Chapter. For there hee expoundeth himſelfe not to ſpeake of the fornicators of the world, but of the Church <hi>v.</hi> 10.11. and for the fornicators of the Church, hee doth forbid Communion with them, not onely in the worſhip of God (as you would have him underſtood) but even in familiar civill converſe, With ſuch a one as is a brother, and a fornicator or the like, I have written to you, no not to eat with him, <hi>v.</hi> 11. where, not to eat is not meant
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:113833:66"/> not to eat the Lords Supper: for that is the higheſt degree of the higheſt, and holieſt communion in the Church: but not to eat com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon bread at one anothers table, for hee ſpeaketh of the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of familiar ſociety with ſuch a one, ſaying, With ſuch a one, no not to eat, but that by the way, to cleare your miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in that point. But for the point in hand, the Apoſtle had ſufficiently cleared both his owne meaning and the <hi>Corinthians</hi> ſcruple touching their civill ſociety with their unbeleeving yoak-fellowes, in expounding himſelfe, not to forbid them Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the fornicators or Idolaters of this world, but of the Church; whence it clearly appeard that their unbeleeving yoak-fellowes being not of the Church, but of the world, it was no part of the Apoſtles meaning in his former, or latter letter, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid them communion with their unbeleeving yoak-fellowes: So that if the ſcruple of the <hi>Corinthiane</hi> had ſprung from the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the Apoſtles former letter, the Apoſtle had there fully cleared his owne meaning, and withall removed their ſcruple: there needed no more words of it againe here. It ſeemeth therefore much more probable, that their ſcruple aroſe from that other place which you mention <hi>Ezra</hi> 10. where the people of God are char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to ſeparate themſelves from the people of the land, and from their ſtrange wives: which charge they obeyed alſo and fulfilled. But if their ſcruple ſprung from that place, then the <hi>Corinthians</hi> had as juſt occaſion to ſcruple the keeping of their children (which they had by theſe wives) as the keeping of their wives. For the people of God in that Chapter of <hi>Ezra,</hi> made an holy Covenant with God, to put away not onely their ſtrange wives, but their children alſo which were borne of them <hi>v.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>Now then let us come to conſider of the Apoſtles anſwer to theſe ſcruples as you expound him.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Apoſtle (ſay you) anſwereth from a double ground.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <q>1. In that all things are ſanctified to ſuch as beleeve <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15. therefore beleevers may have a lawfull uſe of their unbeleeving yoak-fellowes.</q> This concluſion is true and intended by the Apoſtle: but this ground of it the Apoſtle doth not here give, but you fetch it from another Epiſtle. It is true, the marriage of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> with their unbeleeving yoak-fellows, when they were both infidels, being lawfull by Gods inſtitution before, now when one of them came to be converted to the faith, the faith of the beleever did not make his former marriage which was lawfull before, now unlawfull, but rather gave him a pure and ſanctified
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:113833:67"/> uſe, both of his marriage, and of his yoak-fellow. But the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle doth not here give for a ground thereof, the purity of all things to a beleever, though hee might have given it for a juſt ground thereof:) but the onely ground which in this Text hee giveth of it, is taken from the holineſſe of their children. Elſe (ſaith hee) were your children unclean: but now they are holy, which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth, that there is now in the dayes of the New Teſtament, ſuch an holineſſe acknowledged by God to belong to the children from either parent beleeving, as is ſufficient alone, (though there were no other ground of it) to ratify to the beleeving parent a ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied uſe of his unbeleeving yoak-fellow) which holineſſe can bee no other, but the holineſſe which ſpringeth from the Covenant of grace, wherein God promiſeth to bee a God to the beleever and his ſeed. Whereas on the contrary if this holines of the children, did onely ariſe from the lawfulneſſe of the marriage of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, by the ſame ground upon which the <hi>Corinthians</hi> ſcrupled the lawfulneſſe of their marriage with their unbeleeving yoak-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, by the ſame they might juſtly ſcruple the lawfulneſſe of their children, which they had by them, for in that place of <hi>Ezra</hi> (whence you conceive their ſcruple, either ſprung or grew) as the marriage of the Iews with ſtrangers was uncleane; and therefore ſtrange wives to bee put away: ſo their children alſo were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane, and to bee put away alſo according to the counſell of God and the example of the people in that place. Let us then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to examine your ſecond ground, which you ſay, the Apoſtle giveth to ſatisfie the ſcruple of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> about the retaining of their unbeleeving yoak-fellowes.</p>

If you <hi>(Corinthians)</hi> judge your ſelves to live in ſuch a way of uncleanneſſe, upon which you muſt now part, then your children ſo begotten are uncleane alſo, and to be put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. But in that you hold it lawfull to retaine your children, and not to put them away, though you beleeve, and they beleeve not, then much more the unbeleeving Parents that beare them. For if the effect bee holy, then muſt the cauſe be alſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that produceth the ſame: which is Gods holy Ordinance of marriage, and not the holy Covenant of grace.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This ground hath no ground at all, neither in the Apoſtles words, nor meaning: not in his words; for the Apoſtle doth not ſay, your children are holy in your judgement, or as you hold: but the Apoſtle delivereth his owne Iudgement, your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:113833:67"/> are holy. Neither will it ſtand with the Apoſtles meaning, nor with the divine wiſedom &amp; power of an Apoſtolick ſpirit, to prove an holy uſe of the parents mariage, from the conceited holines, which the Parents imagine to bee in their children. For though in Diſputation againſt an adverſary, it may bee of uſe to convince him out of his owne conceits: yet in dealing with a ſcrupulous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, it giveth no ſatisfaction, to give him for grounds of law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Practiſe, his owne conceits.</p>
               <p>Neither hath it any ground at all from the Apoſtles words, or meaning, to gather (as you doe) from the holineſſe of children <q>an argument from the leſſe to the greater, That if the children bee holy, and ſo, lawfull to bee retained, then much more the unbeleeving Parents that bare them (becauſe if the effect bee holy, then muſt the cauſe alſo bee holy:)</q> for the unbeleeving Parents are no cauſe at all of the holineſſe of their children: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are they holy themſelves by the holy Ordinance of marriage. For though marriage it ſelfe bee holy in reſpect of the holy inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of it: yet not in reſpect of the holy efficacy in it, to make all them holy, that enter into marriage eſtate; yea as to beleevers all things are pure, ſo to the unbeleever nothing is pure, no not his marriage, nor his yoak-fellow, nor his children. Though the unbeleeving yoak-fellow (<hi>Paul</hi> ſaith) bee ſanctified to the beleever: yet <hi>Paul</hi> never ſaid, that the beleever is ſanctified to the unbeleeving yoak-fellow. Unbeleevers are neither holy themſelves, nor is any thing elſe ſanctified to them, much leſſe can they bee the cauſe of producing ſanctification and holineſſe in others. And therefore <hi>Paul</hi> doth inferre the holineſſe of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, not from the holy Ordinance of marriage, but from the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Covenant of grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>It had bin in vaine for the Apoſtle to have gon about to prove the lawfull retaining of the unbeleeving yoak-fellow from the holineſſe of their children being in the Covenant.<note place="margin">Silveſter.</note> For nothing was more cleare then this, That ſuch children as are begotten in uncleanneſſe, were not approved of Gods holy Covenant of life: nor any way holy, either by law, or Goſpell; How then could this tend to remove the ſcruple of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> to tell them, that they might lawfully continue together, becauſe their children were in the Covenant of grace and life, and ſo were ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when as their ſcruple lay in matter of uncleanneſſe, upon which they were to part? Now this muſt bee cleared, whether
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:113833:68"/> they were ſo, or not in reſpect of themſelves, before ever they could believe the holineſs of their children, or any ſuch to be in Gods gracious Covenant. For the children of adultery and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication are debarred the holy Covenant, both in the law, and in the Goſpel.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Silvanus.</note>It were well if you did debarre onely the children of adultery and fornication from the holy Covenant now in the Goſpel. But you debarre all children while they are infants, whether they bee the children of lawfull marriage, or of adultery: whether children of beleevers or of infidells; all is one. But ſeeing God (who keepeth Covenant and mercy with thouſands) admitteth believers and their children to the fellowſhip of his Covenant: who is man, or what is the ſonne of man, that hee ſhould debar them?</p>
               <p>But to come to your argument, many things are unſound in it. <q>1. When you ſay, that nothing is more cleare then this, That children begotten in ſuch uncleanneſſe, are not in Gods holy Covenant, nor any way holy, either by Law or Goſpel.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It is too vaſt an Hyperbole, there be many cleare truths gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally received of all that feare God: as the Trinity of Perſons, the unity of the Godhead, Chriſt his two Natures and three Offices, and an hundred ſuch like, which are indeed cleare to all that fear God. But this (which you ſay is moſt cleare to all) that children begotten in uncleanneſſe are debarred the Covenant, is denyed by <hi>Tremelius</hi> and <hi>Junius,</hi> and others moe, and doubted by many. There be many that conceive <hi>Pharez</hi> and <hi>Zerah</hi> were in the holy Covenant, though begotten in Inceſt; and <hi>Davids</hi> child though begotten in adultery. And what would you ſay of all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, which the Patriarchs had by Concubines? They were not borne in lawfull marriage. If therefore they were begotten in uncleanneſſe, were they excluded from the Covenant, and no way holy? What ſay you of <hi>Jepthah</hi> begotten of a ſtrange woman, and therefore in uncleanneſſe? Doe you thinke God did not approve him to be in his Covenant, ſeeing he called him forth to be a Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of his people? If you ſay <hi>Iepthah</hi> was then faithfull when God called him forth to office: What then? yet he was begotten in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe. And then your aſſertion was too large, without any <q>limitation to ſay, That children begotten in uncleanneſſe are not in Gods holy Covenant, nor any way holy, either by law or Goſpel, and that nothing is more clear then this.</q>
               </p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:113833:68"/>
               <p>As for the place upon which you ground (as I conceive) your aſſertion, taken out of <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.2. ſome underſtood it of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in and out before the Congregation, to wit, in bearing pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Office. Others underſtand it to ſpeake of a Baſtard begotten of a common Harlot; which I note to you, not to ſhew you my owne interpretation of the place, but to wiſh you to forbeare ſuch exceſſive prodigall expreſſions; That nothing is more cleare, then that which is darke and doubtfull to many men, men of as cleare, and it may be clearer diſcernings then your ſelves.</p>
               <p>But for my part, I will not ſtick with you in this point altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; let it be granted that children begotten in uncleanneſſe (that is, as you expound your ſelfe) <q>begotten in adultery and forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, are not in Gods holy Covenant, nor any way holy (for ought we can diſcerne, leaving Gods election of them unto ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, to himſelfe) either by Law or Goſpel; what then? Why then ſay you, how could this tend to remove the Corinthians ſcruple, to tell them they might lawfully continue together as man and wife, becauſe their children were in the Covenant of grace and life, and ſo were holy; when as the ſcruple lay in matter of uncleanneſſe upon which they were to part; which ſcruple muſt firſt be cleared in reſpect of themſelves, before ever they could believe the holineſſe of their children in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; ſeeing the children of adultery and fornication are debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the holy Covenant both in the Law and the Goſpel?</q>
               </p>
               <p>But this is more unſound then the former, to conceive that the matter of uncleanneſſe upon which they were to part, was the uncleanneſſe of adultery and fornication. For if that were the uncleanneſſe in which thoſe Corinthian yoke-fellows lived before either of them were converted to the faith, ſurely the Apoſtle would never have given them advice, not to depart one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>v. r.</hi> 12, 13. Such as live in the uncleanneſſe of adultery and fornication ought not to abide together, but ſpeedily to depart one from another. Yea, methinkes in caſe of adultery, the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians would of themſelves diſcerne what was meet, to wit, ſpeedily and utterly to abandon ſuch wickedneſſe, or at leaſt have lurked in it ſecretly, and never have conſulted with the Apoſtle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it in a publick Church-letter. It is true, it was matter of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe upon which they doubted they muſt part, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſcrupled cohabitation. But the uncleanneſſe which they ſuſpected, was not adultery or fornication, but diſparity of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:113833:69"/> in regard of the Infidell yoke-fellow, who ſtill lived in Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry. But this uncleanneſſe of Idolatry lying not upon both yoke-fellows, but upon one onely; it could not debarre the free paſſage of the holy Covenant from the believing parent to the children. For the Covenant runneth not unto you and to your ſeed, as ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of both the Parents, but to thee and to thy ſeed, as ſpeaking of one of them, of either of them.</p>
               <p>If you ask, why then did the Jews put away their ſtrange wives and children, ſeeing the Covenant might paſſe to the children from either party?</p>
               <p>I anſwer two things, 1. The Iſraelites were expreſly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to marry with thoſe Nations, and their ſeed was excluded from entring into the congregation to the tenth generation, <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.3. <hi>Neh.</hi> 13.1. But Chriſtians in the dayes of the Goſpel, lye not under any ſuch prohibition. There is no ſuch partition wall now between Nation and Nation; nor any ſuch ſevere rejection of the children of any Nation, in caſe either of the Parents be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into the Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The caſe of the Jewes who married ſtrange wives in <hi>Ezra,</hi> was not the like caſe with that of the Corinthians, though the Corinthians might conceive the caſe to be the ſame. For the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians had married their Idolatrous yoke-fellows, when both of them were Pagans. But the Jews married their ſtrange wives, when themſelves were an holy people. Now though the Jewes were therefore bound to put away their ſtrange wives, when they had thus polluted the holy Covenant, and the holy ſeed: Yet even in the times of the Law, if a Gentile Proſelyte (eſpecially of a remote Countrey) were converted to the Jewiſh Religion, hee was not bound to put away his children which he had by his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan wife (whom hee had married in the dayes of his ignorance) but he was bound to circumciſe them as well as himſelfe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.48. And therefore hee was not bound to put them away, but to account them holy, and within the Covenant, and ſo capable of the ſeale of the Covenant. And ſince this believing Proſelyte was holy, and his ſeed alſo holy, hee might therefore have a ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified uſe of his wife, though ſhe ſtill continued unbelieving. And therefore if ſhee conſented to dwell with him, hee ought not (no not then) to have put her away, but to abide with her, which is the very caſe of the Corinthians here; and the one of them doth fitly and fully illuſtrate the other.</p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:113833:69"/>
               <p>And therefore further, it is not a ſound ſpeech, which you ſay, touching theſe Corinthian yoke-fellows (whereof one was a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, the other an unbeliever) <q>that this muſt firſt bee cleared whether they were uncleane or not, in reſpect of themſelves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ever they could believe the holineſſe of their children, or any ſuch to bee in Gods gracious Covenant.</q> For as it was with thoſe Proſelytes of old, ſo it was with the Corinthians then. The believing Corinthian had juſt ground (though hee knew not ſo much) to believe himſelfe to bee in the Covenant of grace, as well as the believing Proſelyte: and his ſeed to be holy, and in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and to have right to the ſeale of the Covenant, as well as the ſeed of the believing Proſelyte. And from both to conclude, to wit, both from his owne faith, and from the holineſſe of his children, that hee therefore hath a ſanctified uſe of his yoke-fellow, though yet uncleane in her ſelfe through her unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe.</p>
               <p>And therefore take notice further, that it is another unſound ſpeech of yours to ſay, That it had been in vaine for the Apoſtle, <q>To goe about to prove the lawfull retaining of the unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving yoke-fellow, from the holineſſe of the children being in Covenant.</q>
               </p>
               <p>For the Apoſtle doth goe about to prove that very point from that very ground, and from none other, in that 14 <hi>ver.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither was it vaine ſo to doe, unleſſe wee charge vanity upon the holy Spirit of wiſdome, and truth and power that guided him. And indeed the Argument is of eternall force both in the Church of Iſrael, and in Chriſtian Churches, as hath beene ſhewn above.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>But this ſeemeth a very unſound point to mee,<note place="margin">Silveſter:</note> (which I ſee you build much upon in this diſcourſe) which I cannot paſſe, that by vertue of a believers eſtate in grace, all his fruit is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and partaketh in the ſame eſtate of grace with him: unleſſe they doe by ſome act of their owne deprive themſelves of it, as did <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael.</hi> Againſt which I beiefly oppoſe theſe Arguments.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Firſt, if this be a truth, then one may bee ſaved by another mans faith. For here by vertue of a believers ſtate in grace all his fruit (that is, his children) partake of the ſame with him, and ſo farre as hee doth, onely by vertue of his grace, or ſtate in grace, which is the ſame: And ſo by the Fathers faith
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:113833:70"/> the Children ſhare together with him in that Grace, which his faith inſtates him in, which is ſalvation it ſelf.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Secondly, This Doctrine taketh away the being of Originall ſinne; for here they are all holy, and partakers of Grace, untill they commit ſome actuall ſin, which denyeth any Originall ſin: for that would make them unholy, though they never committed actuall ſin in their own perſons.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Thirdly, it layeth a ground of falling out of an eſtate of grace. For by this Doctrine <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> and all the Children of Beleevers are holy, and partakers of the ſame grace, before they committed actuall ſin, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.23. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11, 12, 13. And ſo <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.20, 21. and 21.9, 10.12. But as it tends to Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and Arminianiſme, ſo I ſhall leave it, as an old Creed, bare Error, not worth any further medling with.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Silvanus</note>Your bare miſtake of our Doctrine in this point, maketh your Arguments to fight againſt an errour indeed, and bare enough: but not againſt any Article of our Creed, which wee confeſſe to bee all old, even as old, as the ancient and everlaſting Covenant: and yet never a whit the more old and bare, by Crediting, but the more new and warm by beleeving. For to the beleever (as to the New Creature) all things become new, whereas in your deſpoiling and ſtripping the Infant Children of beleevers out of the bands (the ſwadling bands) of the Covenant, you conſpire with old <hi>Adam</hi> herein in their deſtruction: For as hee killed them by his fall, ſo you bury them not in the Land of Promiſe, but in the pit of perdition, and land of oblivion and forgetfulneſſe: as forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of God in his Election, forgotten of Chriſt in his Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, forgotten of the Holy Ghoſt in his Sanctification: and ſo quite out of the way of holineſſe and Grace; without Covenant, without Hope, without Chriſt, without God in the world.</p>
               <p>But to come to your miſtake of our Doctrine, which lyeth not in this: That by vertue of a beleevers eſtate, wee hold all his fruite to bee holy. For wee acknowledge, that (rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, as you know wee expreſſe our ſelves) that by vertue of a beleevers eſtate, together with the vertue of the Covenant of grace to him and his ſeed, all his fruite is holy. But when you adde (and partake in the ſame eſtate of grace with him) there you quite mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake us. For though all the fruite of a beleever bee holy: yet all of them doe not partake with him in the ſame eſtate of all kindes of holineſſe, which their beleeving Father injoyeth: much leſſe ſo
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:113833:70"/> farre as he doth. For whereas there be three ſorts of holineſſe (as hath been touched above) 1. One by imputation from Chriſt. 2. Another by regeneration from the Spirit. 3. A third by ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to God and to his Worſhip, and to participation of the Ordinances through the Covenant: The believing Parent enjoyeth all theſe; but not ſo all his ſeed. All of them indeed partake of the laſt: Of the firſt, onely the elect; but not of the ſecond, till they be regenerate. And againſt our Doctrine thus declared, your argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments fall like <hi>Dagon</hi> before the Arke of the Covenant.</p>
               <p>For to the firſt, we readily anſwer; It followeth not that if our Doctrine be a truth, then one may be ſaved by anothers faith. For we doe not teach that all within the Covenant, or all that are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the Covenant are ſaved, or are in a ſtate of ſalvation: But that by the Covenant they are either in a ſtate of ſalvation, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the meanes of ſalvation. Neither doe we teach that all under the Covenant of grace, are in a ſtate of grace, unleſſe a ſtate of grace be taken in a large ſenſe for ſuch a ſtate, in which they receive the offer and meanes of grace, which to the elect ſeed doe become effectual; <q>much leſſe do we teach, that by vertue of a believers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a ſtate of grace, all his children doe partake of the ſame grace with him, and that ſo farre as he doth.</q> Theſe things wee neither believe nor profeſſe; neither can they be gathered from our doctrine by any juſt conſequence.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to your ſecond, the anſwer is as eaſie. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. We doe not ſay, that the children of believers are holy with that holineſſe which accompanyeth regeneration, and mortifieth originall corruption, but onely with that holineſſe whereby they are admitted to the meanes of grace, with promiſe of efficacy to the elect ſeed, and offers thereof to the reſt, ſo farre as to leave them without excuſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Suppoſe we did hold (that which is farre from us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) that all infants in the Covenant were regenerate, and ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as well as their beleeving. Parents, and as farre as they; Yet that would not take away the being or remaining of Originall ſinne in them, but onely the reigning of it. For doe you thinke that the being of Originall ſin is taken away from regenerate believers? We for our part believe what we have cauſe to grone under, that Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall ſin remaineth in a believer; and though it be pardoned and in ſome meaſure mortified, yet it is not utterly deſtroyed till death.</p>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:113833:71"/>
               <p>
                  <q>To your third, wee deny that our doctrine is any ground of falling away out of an eſtate of grace;</q> if you ſpeake of an eſtate of ſaving grace. For wee doe not ſay, that all within the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, or under the ſeale of the Covenant, are in an eſtate of ſaving grace. Though in a large ſenſe all the members of the Church, whether Infants or Profeſſors of the faith, are in ſuch a ſtate of grace, as that they do partake of the common gifts of grace, and of the Ordinances of grace. Nevertheleſſe they may fall away from ſuch grace; which the Apoſtle feared in ſome of the <hi>Galatians, Gal.</hi> 5.4.</p>
               <p>To your fourth and laſt we anſwer, it were a falſe ſlander, if you <q>ſhould report that our Doctrine doth hold forth, that ever <hi>Eſau</hi> or <hi>Iſhmael</hi> were ſubjects of a ſaving eſtate of ſaving grace:</q> For though we ſay, they were borne under the Covenant of grace, and were made partakers of the ſeale of the Covenant, yet wee doe not ſay they were ever ſubjects of Gods ſaving grace. It is a grace to partake in the meanes of grace, and in the enjoyment of many gifts of common grace, and in the offers of ſaving grace; and yet many have enjoyed all theſe, who nevertheleſſe were never ſubjects of ſaving grace, neither of election, whereof your two former texts ſpeake, nor of perſeverance in the Covenant, whereof your two latter ſpeake. And to fall from ſuch an eſtate of grace, I leave it to you upon ſecond thoughts to judge, whether it tend to Popery and Arminianiſme, or no.</p>
               <p>To gather up then the ſumme of all this diſcourſe about the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of <hi>Abraham</hi> to an head: You have ſeen it now proved and maintained againſt all exceptions,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That God made a Covenant of grace with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That God gave circumciſion to be a ſeale of the ſame Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to <hi>Abraham</hi> and to all his infant-ſeed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That by the redemption of Chriſt, the Covenant and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> is come upon the beleeving Gentiles and our ſeed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Theſe things being already cleared, the fourth thing that remaineth to be cleared, is, that circumciſion being now aboliſhed, Baptiſme ſucceedeth in the roome thereof, as a ſeale of the ſame Covenant to believers and our ſeed. Which, if it may appeare, then it will appeare alſo, that the ſame Covenant of grace, which gave a Commandement, or word of inſtitution for the Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of faithfull <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed, doth alſo hold forth the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:113833:71"/> ſame commandement, and word of inſtitution, for the Baptiſm of faithfull Gentiles and our ſeed.</p>
               <p>Now that Baptiſme doth ſucceed Circumciſion it is evident from the teſtimony of <hi>Paul, Col.</hi> 2.11, 12. where the Apoſtle having proved that we are compleat in Chriſt, by the fulneſſe of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head dwelling in him, <hi>v.</hi> 9, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>0. Leſt it might bee objected that wee want circumciſion, and conſequently we want the ſpirituall bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit ſignified and ſealed by it, which is the cutting off of the body of the ſinnes of the fleſh, the Apoſtle anſwereth, wee are circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed with the circumciſion made without hands, in putting off the body of the ſinnes of the fleſh, by the circumciſion of Chriſt, <hi>v.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>And leſt it ſhould have been objected againe, that wee want an outward ſigne and ſeale of this ſpirituall benefit, the putting off of the body of the ſinnes of the fleſh. The Apoſtle anſwereth again; no neither doe we want the outward ſign and ſeale thereof, we being buried with him in Baptiſme, <hi>v.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Argument ſeemeth to me ſomewhat weake;<note place="margin">Silveſter.</note> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a weake anſwer ſhall ſerve. What though Baptiſme ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed circumciſion, muſt it needs follow, that as infants were circumciſed, ſo they muſt of neceſſity be baptized? The new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament ſucceedeth the Old; muſt it needs therefore follow, that the ſame Order be obſerved now, as then?</q>
               </p>
               <p>It is well that you acknowledge the weakneſſe of your anſwer;<note place="margin">Silvanus</note> for if you had not, the weakneſſe of it bewrayeth it ſelfe; but we acknowledge no weakneſſe of the Argument, unleſſe it bee the weakneſſe of God, which (the Apoſtle ſaith) is ſtronger then men, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.25. But you are deceived, if you thinke a weake anſwer will ſerve a weake argument; a weake adverſary deſpiſed, gathereth ſtrength by contempt. The Gileadites being deſpiſed as fugitives, proved too heard for the Ephraimites, <hi>Judg.</hi> 12.4. The Jewes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſpiſed for a feeble company, ſtrengthened themſelves in God from the contempt of their deſpiſers, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 4.2, 3, 4. yea, there is no ſinfull weakneſſe of the Creature, no not any weak thought, but requireth weapons mighty through God, to ſubdue it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4, 5. And therefore you are much miſtaken, when you thinke a weake Anſwer will ſerve a weak Argument.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>But let us conſider your anſwer, ſuch as it is. What though (ſay you) Baptiſme ſucceedeth Circumciſion? muſt it needs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:113833:72"/> that as infants were circumciſed, they muſt of neceſſity be baptized?</q>
               </p>
               <p>Yes verily; or elſe Baptiſme doth not ſucceed Circumciſion, for what is ſucceſſion, but the ſubſtitution of latter things for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer things in the ſame ſubject? If the ſubject bee changed, ſo farre as there is a change of the ſubject, there is no ſucceſſion. If <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhazzar</hi> dye, and <hi>Cyrus,</hi> or <hi>Darius</hi> reigne in <hi>Perſia,</hi> here is no ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. But if <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> King of the Chaldeans die, and <hi>Darius</hi> King of <hi>Perſia</hi> ſucceed in the Kingdome of the Chaldees, then there is a true ſucceſſion; elſe not, eſpecially in the caſe in hand, it was requiſite for the clearing of the Apoſtles doctrine, that Baptiſm ſhould ſucceed upon all thoſe perſons on whom Circumciſion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded: or elſe the weakneſſe of your Argument will weaken the ſtrength of the Apoſtles Argument For the Apoſtle is to prove, that we are compleat in Chriſt, not only in the inward Circumciſion of the heart, which taketh away the ſinfull body of the fleſh, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in the ſigne and ſeale of it, even our Baptiſm, which doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the ſame things unto us, and giveth us as effectuall fellowſhip in Chriſts death and buriall, to the putting away of ſinne, as they had in circumciſion. But take away the Baptiſme of Infants, and the Apoſtles argument will faile. For it might be objected, that the Jewes in their circumciſion of themſelves and their Infants, had a ſigne and ſeale, that God would circumciſe not onely their owne hearts, but the hearts of their Infant-ſeed alſo; but wee in our Baptiſme, though we have a ſigne and ſeale that God will waſh and purifie our hearts, yet not ſo the hearts of our Infants alſo. And therefore we are leſſe compleat in Chriſt in our Baptiſme, then the Jewes were in their circumciſion, which if it were admitted, would utterly evacuate the Apoſtles argument; who pleadeth our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatneſſe in Chriſt, notwithſtanding our want of circumciſion, in that we enjoy the like fulneſſe of benefit in our Baptiſm, as the Jews did in their circumciſion. But admit the Baptiſme of our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, as well as of our ſelves, to ſucceed in the place of circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Jews and their infants; and then the Apoſtles argument proceedeth fully, and concludeth invincibly; That we are as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat in <hi>Chriſt</hi> in our Baptiſm, as the Iews were in their circumciſion.</p>
               <p>Put us not off therefore with a difference of Order in the New Teſtament, and in the Old; The New Teſtament (ſay you) ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth the Old; <q>muſt it needs therefore follow, that the ſame order be obſerved now, as then?</q> For though the order may bee
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:113833:72"/> changed in ſucceſſion, yet the extent and amplitude of the ſubjects is not changed, eſpecially not ſtraitned or diminiſhed, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged in a growing ſtate. The order of <hi>Solomons</hi> houſe (who ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded <hi>David</hi>) was changed not a little in point of magnificence from the order of <hi>Davids</hi> houſe: but yet the ſubjects were the ſame, or rather more abundant and numerous, none of <hi>Davids</hi> ſubjects being excluded. It is true, in a declining and decaying ſtate, the extent and amplitude of <hi>Rehoboams</hi> ſubjects were not ſo large, as thoſe of <hi>Solomons</hi> whom he ſucceeded. But I hope you will not make <hi>Rehoboam</hi> a type of Chriſt, in his folly and decay of his Dominion, but rather looke at <hi>Solomon</hi> as an intended type of Chriſt, even in the latitude of his Dominion, that above <hi>Davids;</hi> from Sea to Sea, from the River unto the ends of the earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Lords Supper ſucceedeth the Paſſeover;<note place="margin">Silveſter.</note> but though all the whole houſhold of every family (as well children as other) were to eate the Paſſeover, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.3, 4. yet infants are not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved as fit communicants of the Lords Supper, becauſe they are not capable ſubjects.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But how doe you make it appeare I pray you,<note place="margin">Silvanus.</note> that infants were to eate the Paſſeover? a roaſted Lambe with unleavened bread, and ſowre herbs, is no meat for infants; neither doth it appeare by the Chapter which you alledge, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.1. that children of more growth were admitted to partake of the Paſſeover, till they were able to diſcerne the ſpirituall nature and uſe of it. According to what is writen, <hi>v.</hi> 26, 27. of that chapter.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>When your children (ſaith <hi>Moſes</hi>) ſhall ſay unto you, What meane you by this ſervice? ye ſhall ſay, It is the ſacrifice of the Lords Paſſeover, who paſſed over our houſes in <hi>Egypt,</hi> when hee ſmote the <hi>Egyptians.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>It is true (that you ſay) children are not capable ſubjects of the Lords Supper: For receiving whereof, the Apoſtle requireth wee ſhould examine and judge our ſelves. But Infants are as capable ſubjects of Baptiſme now in the dayes of the New Teſtament, as the Infants of the Jews were of Circumciſion. For circumciſion and baptiſme being both of them alike ſignes and ſeales of our new birth (either wrought, or to be wrought;) and in our new birth, we being meerely paſſive, children are as capable ſubjects paſſively to bee wrought upon to a new birth, as men of riper yeares. But the Lords Supper being a ſigne and ſeale of our ſpirituall growth in Chriſt, and diſpenſed not in milke, but in ſtrong meat, bread and
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:113833:73"/> wine, whereunto holy preparation was requiſite, Infants are not capable ſubjects of this, though they bee of the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Silveſter.</note>But why then are Faith and Repentance required unto Baptiſm, which was not of old time required unto Circumciſion?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Silvanus.</note>Faith and Repentance and the Profeſſion of both, were of old required in men of yeers, not to make them capable ſubjects of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, but to receive them into the fellowſhip of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to themſelves and their ſeed. Hence <hi>Abraham</hi> was found faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, before God did receive him into this Covenant, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9.8. And the like is to bee thought of all the Gentile Proſelites; for the firſt in every kinde is an example and pattern to all that follow after. And ſo the Lord deſcribeth the eſtate of Proſelites, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 56.3. to 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Silveſter.</note>But why ſhould then <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt, and <hi>Philip,</hi> and the Apoſtles require the profeſſion of Faith and Repentance even of the Jewes and Proſelites who were in Covenant before, before they would admit them (as capable ſubjects) unto Baptiſme?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Silvanus.</note>Becauſe the Meſſiah being then come (who was the chief bleſſing of the Covenant, yea, the very ſubſtance of the Covenant, and is therefore himſelf called the Covenant, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.6. and 49.8.)

For then was the Axe laid to the root of the Tree, even to the ſtock of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to all the branches that grew upon it, and were ingraffed into it.

But if they did hold forth Repentance and Faith in Chriſt, then the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and Promiſe which was made to them, and to their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren before, did ſtill continue unto them, and to their Children. And that is the very ground and meaning of <hi>Peters</hi> exhortation to the Jewes and Proſelites, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38, 39. Repent, ſaith hee, and bee Baptized every one of you in the name of the Lord Jeſus, &amp;c. For the Promiſe is to you, and to your Children, &amp;c. as hath been opened above.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Silveſter.</note>To keep to the point in hand, wee are here ſpeaking of Infants, whom you wake to bee capable ſubjects of Baptiſme (as well as
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:113833:73"/> the Jewiſh Infants were of Circumciſion) and yet not capable of the Lords Sapper. <q>But this ſeemeth a double myſtery to mee, how perſons are fit and capable of union in a ſtate, that are not fit and capable of Communion in the Ordinances of the ſame ſtate. And yet more myſticall, how one ſhould bee a capable ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Baptiſme, and not of the Supper. I can ſee no rule for ſuch a practiſe in all the Book of God. And it is againſt the rule of Nature, that when a Childe is born, it ſhould bee kept from food.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It troubleth mee to hear you call ſuch plain points both in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and Nature, Myſteries,<note place="margin">Silvanus.</note> whereby you mean dark Riddles above your capacity. It was a ſad ſpeech of our Saviour concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch as to whom it was not given to know the myſteries of God, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.11. The Lord give you underſtanding in his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Myſteries. <q>When you make it a myſtery, how perſons can bee fit and capable of union in a ſtate, and yet not bee fit and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Communion in the Ordinances of the ſame ſtate:</q> You know wee eſteeme infants fit and capable Perſons of the Covenant, and of the ſeale of it, Baptiſme. If you thinke otherwiſe, then you doe expreſly make Infants unfit and uncapable of Union with Chriſt, or with his Church, and ſo uncapable of the Kingdom of Heaven: Which ſometime you diſclaime. But if you ſpeak of (all) Ordinances, you ſpeak againſt common ſenſe, and experience. Infants are members of the Common-wealth, and ſo are they alſo of the family: and accordingly fit and capable of Union with both eſtates. And yet they are neither capable of the Ordinance of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment, nor of the Ordinance of obedience to the Laws and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in either ſtate.</p>
               <p>And why ſhould it ſeem more myſticall to you, that Infants ſhould bee capable of Baptiſm, and yet not bee capable of the Lords Supper? You have ſeen even now a reaſon of both, both in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Nature. <q>And therefore doe not ſay, you can ſee no rule for it in all the Book of God: and it is againſt a rule in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to keep a Childe born from his food.</q>
               </p>
               <p>For Baptiſme holding forth the death and buriall and Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Chriſt, if there bee food in theſe (as there bee food in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed) then children born, that want not theſe (as in Baptiſme they are adminiſtred to them) they want not food.

               </p>
               <p>I willingly acknowledge that the two Teſtaments, are two Wills, containing ſuch Legacies, as are bequeathed and given onely to ſuch, whoſe names are either expreſſely ſet down, or whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is plainly deſcribed in them; Otherwiſe, if you ſtand upon expreſſe names, are there any ſuch names expreſſely ſet down, as <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Rowland, Richard</hi> and <hi>Robert, Godfrey</hi> and <hi>Geoffrey,</hi> or the like? And would you exclude all ſuch whoſe names are not expreſſely ſet down, from any Legacies in either Teſtament? But I take your meaning to bee, by names, to underſtand Natures, or Conditions: and by expreſſely ſet down, to underſtand plainly deſcribed. The place which you alledge out of <hi>Revel.</hi> 21.27. is a part of the deſcription of the pure Church of the Jewes, after their laſt Converſion (the New <hi>Hieruſalem</hi>) by the condition of ſuch Proſelytes, as from among the Nations ſhall enter into fellowſhip with them. They ſhall not bee prophane perſons, defilers and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupters of others, nor makers of images which are abominations and lies. And thus far the deſcription agreeth to Infants, as well as to men of riper yeers. As for the other part of the deſcription, that none ſhall enter but ſuch as are writen in the Lambes book of life; this I would ſay to it:</p>
               <p n="1">1. You cannot juſtly deny, but that Gods Teſtimony of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of Beleevers, that they are holy (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14.) and that of ſuch is the Kingdom of God, <hi>Mark.</hi> 10.14. is as good an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their Election, as the Profeſſion of Faith and Repentance, which men of yeers are wont to make, is an evidence of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection before the Church. Again,</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is one thing, to ſpeak of ſuch as enter into the Church (for
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:113833:75"/> that agreeth to ſuch as were ſometime without:) another thing, to ſpeake of the Infants of believers, who were never out of the Church, and ſo cannot be ſaid to enter into it. Beſides,</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is one thing to enter into the Church as an abiding mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; another thing ſo to enter, as for ſome notorious ſcandall to be caſt out of it. Such ſhall be the purity of the Government of that new <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> as that no prophane perſon ſhall enter into it, nor any hypocrite: or if any hypocrite ſhould creepe in (as there did in the moſt pure and diſcerning times, even in the Apoſtles dayes) yet they will in time be diſcerned, and then caſt out: Otherwiſe there would be no uſe of excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in thoſe pure Iewiſh Churches; which is not probable. Yea, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants themſelves, though borne in the Church; yet if when they grow up to yeares they ſhall degenerate into a prophane or ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous courſe, they ſhall not be tolerated to abide in the Church: yea, if they ſhall not take hold of the Covenant of their Fathers, but content themſelves in an ignorant, or civill, or worldly courſe of life, they ſhall not bee allowed to enter into holy communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the ſincere members of the Church at the Lords Table.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is one thing to prophecy of the tranſcendent glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious happineſſe of an exact pure Church in ſome age of it: ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing to command and foretell the perpetuall continuance of it in the ſame degree of purity. Sure I am, that when Chriſt commeth to judgement, he ſhall find in thoſe pure Churches of the Jews ſome fooliſh Virgins, as well as ſome wiſe. And the fooliſh Virgins ſhall bee ſhut out from the preſence of Chriſt (<hi>Mat.</hi> 25.10, 11, 12.) And they that are ſhut out, were never written in the Lambs book of life.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is one thing to ſpeake of the members of the Church uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally; another thing to ſpeake of them all indefinitely; all of them, (that is, the body of them, or the greater part of them) may be ſaid to be written in the Lambs booke of life, to bee all righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.21.) to have their ſinnes forgiven, and not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of any ſickneſſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.21. But how can this bee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood univerſally of all the members of the Church at all times?</p>
               <p n="6">6. It is one thing to ſpeake of the condition, in which God approveth Church-members; another thing to ſpeak of the condition, in which God approveth the receiving of Church-members. God never approved the condition of <hi>Judas</hi> in his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtleſhip,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:113833:75"/> or in his Church-memberſhip; and yet hee approved the receiving of him into both.</p>
               <p>But to proceed to the difference which you make of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the two Teſtaments, though that bee a point ſcanned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and needleſly repeated here: When you make the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <q>to bequeath Legacies to a male of eight dayes old, or to a Proſelyte, and for that end quote <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.10, 14, 23, 25. with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Scriptures; and the New Teſtament to beſtow Legacies (as the Priviledges and bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi>) onely to ſuch as believe, and none elſe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>You ſpeake not herein according to the language of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. For the Scripture never calleth the Teſtament or Covenant which God made with <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17. the Old Teſtament: your miſtake herein hath been a principall occaſion of corrupting your judgement, both in this point in hand, and ſundry other that have reference to it. I have ſhewed you above, that the Teſtament which the Scripture calleth the Old Teſtament, was that made with the Iſraelites on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> not that made with <hi>Abraham, (Gen.</hi> 17.) in the land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> It had been ſmall comfort to us, that Chriſt by his death ſhould procure us this priviledge, that the bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> might come upon believing Gentiles, if the bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> were not better then the Old Teſtament, or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant: of which the Apoſtle ſaid long agoe (even in his time) it was ready to vaniſh away, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.13. and was indeed ſoon after (with the Temple) wholly aboliſhed.</p>
               <p>It is true, the Covenant of <hi>Abraham</hi> bequeathed this Legacy to a male of eight dayes old, to bee circumciſed; but circumciſion was onely the ſeale of the Covenant. The chiefe Legacy bequea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed in that Covenant, was the promiſe that God would bee a Father to <hi>Abraham</hi> and to his ſeed. And a God hee was to them, whilſt they were yet in the wombe, or being borne, were not yet come to be eight dayes of old. Elſe all the Infants of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that dyed in their firſt weeke, lived and dyed out of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. And ſo the Covenant ſhall depend upon the ſeale, not the ſeale upon the Covenant: and the grace of the Covenant ſhall not know, nor acknowledge, nor owne infants the firſt ſeven dayes, untill the eight; and ſo the eternall Jehovah (to whom a thouſand yeers is but as one day) ſhall limit the grace of his eternall Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, not to ſhine forth upon the Infants of believers, til the eighth day ſhine forth upon them. It remaineth therefore that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:113833:76"/> of <hi>Abraham</hi> and of his ſeed were under the Covenant aſſoone as they were his ſeed, to wit, even from their conception, though none of them were circumciſed, but the males only, nor the males neither, till the eighth day. The males onely, partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Females had not ſuch a foreskin of their fleſh, as was to be circumciſed; partly becauſe God would have them trained up (both males and females) to expect all the bleſſing of their cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, from the circumciſion of Chriſt Jeſus, mentioned, <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſ.</hi> 2.11. Neither were the males circumciſed till the eigthth day, not becauſe they were not ſubjects of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Covenant till the eighth day, but for ſome ceremoniall reſpect, or for ſome other reaſon peculiar to that Rite. Circumciſion being a cutting of the fleſh, it was a worke of mercy not to put infants the firſt weeke to the paine, till they were better able to beare it. Some have ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thought the circumciſion of the eighth day did prefigure the ſanctification of the eighth day for a Sabbath in the dayes of the Meſſiah. Others have thought God would have Circumciſion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred till the eighth day, that a Sabbath might paſſe over the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, that he might ſolemnly renew his Covenant with God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſeale of the Covenant ſhould bee applyed to his Infant. Others have conceived, that as God would not have a Kid or Lamb ſacrificed to him till it had ſucked of the Dam ſeven dayes; ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would hee call forth the infant to be ſolemnly preſented and offered to him in that ſeale of the Covenant, till the ſeven dayes were fulfilled. However it was, certaine it is that the limitation of the eighth day, was not a morall appendant to the Covenant of grace. And therefore the Infants of believers, both in thoſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, and in theſe now, partaked in the Legacies of the Covenant of grace, as well before eight days, as after.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Nay (ſay you) in the New Teſtament, as the laſt Will of Chriſt, the Legacies therein contained (as the Priviledges and bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi>) are given onely to ſuch as believe, and to none elſe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Two things let me here anſwer you.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It implyeth a contradiction to ſay, the bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> is given to believers, and onely to believers, and to none elſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending thereby to exclude the infants of believers. For what is the bleſſing of <hi>Abraham?</hi> Is it not this promiſe of grace, that God will bee a God to him and his ſeed? If this bleſſing then come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on believers, then this promiſe commeth upon them; That God
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:113833:76"/> will be a God to them and their ſeed. You muſt therefore either deny the bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> to come upon believers; or elſe you muſt grant the promiſe of grace to come upon them and upon their ſeed alſo. <q>Yea, (ſay you) upon their believing ſeed, ſuch as ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed them in the ſame faith and truth, not upon others.</q> If that were the meaning of the promiſe, it could not bee ſaid with any congruity of ſpeech, that the promiſe commeth upon the ſeed of believers at all. For when the children of believers come to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, the promiſe commeth not to them at all as the ſeed of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, but as believers themſelves. The children of Pagans when they come to beleeve, may as well claim the promiſe to belong unto them, as may the children of believers, when themſelves doe believe.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing that I would anſwer you, is, that all the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which you alledge to prove, that the priviledges of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt doe belong only unto believers, they onely ſpeake of ſaving priviledges flowing from faith: All which wee readily grant you, (as a point out of controverſie) doe all of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to believers, and not immediately to the children of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, till they come on themſelves to believe likewiſe. But this wee further claime in the behalfe of the children of believers (which wee have proved before, though you are willing to take no notice of it) that the children of believers doe come on themſelves to believe, by reaſon of the Covenant of grace which God hath made with believers and their ſeed, for by that Covenant hee hath promiſed to write the law of faith (as of all other ſaving graces) in their hearts, that they alſo may come in Gods time and way to enjoy all the other ſaving priviledges of the Covenant, as did their Fathers before them. To take a ſhort ſurvey of the places, which you quote, that Text in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.22. holdeth forth that the promiſe (to wit, the promiſe of eternall life, of which he ſpake in the next verſe before) is given by faith to them that believe. So is alſo the righteouſneſſe of faith given to them that believe, as the other places you quote, ſhew, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11, 12. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.6, 7. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the inheritance of glory is given to ſonnes, even the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſonnes of God, who have received the ſpirit of adoption, as your other place ſheweth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. But what doth all this prove? That no Legacies of the New Teſtament, no priviledges of the Covenant of grace, no bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> belongeth to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of believers. It proveth indeed that the righteouſneſſe of faith and eternall life and glory, doe belong to believers, and to
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:113833:77"/> ſuch as are regenerate by the ſpirit of adoption. But what thinke you of faith it ſelfe, and the ſpirit of adoption? Are they not alſo Legacies of the New Teſtament? Are they not the Priviledges of the Covenant, and of the bleſſing of <hi>Abraham?</hi> And theſe when they are firſt given, they are not given to believers, who have them already; but to ſuch as have them not: And therefore the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of believers are capable of theſe Legacies and priviledges, by the bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> in the new Covenant. For this is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the new Covenant, they ſhall all know mee from the leaſt of them to the greateſt of them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.34. And that knowledge is faith upon which ſinnes are forgiven, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.11. And this is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther promiſe of the ſame Covenant, I will poure my Spirit upon thy ſeed, and my bleſſing upon thine off-ſpring, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.3. If then the Spirit and Faith be given by the New Teſtament, (or which is all one, the new Covenant) then all the Legacies, and priviledges, and bleſſings of the Covenant, are not given onely believers, but ſome alſo to the children of believers, that they may receive the ſpirit and faith alſo. It is therefore a ſlender evaſion to alledge <q>(as you doe) that the children and off-ſpring of believers are ſuch onely, as ſucceed them in the ſame faith and truth,</q> and ſo are called the generation of the righteous. For they did not ſucceed them in the ſame faith, and truth, and righteouſneſſe, till it was given them; and given them it was by a legacy of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when they were onely the children of the faithfull, and had neither faith, nor truth, nor righteouſneſſe in them. The other places which you quote, do ſhew, that men of yeares, (as well as children) are ſometimes called the ſeed of the Church. And that the godly ones amongſt them are begotten of the immortall ſeed of the word, and are regenerate by the ſpirit of grace, have a ſeed of God dwelling in them, are maligned by the carnall ſeed, are approved of God, and acknowledged as heires of the Kingdome of glory. All which are truths out of queſtion. But none of all the places doe exclude the Infants of believers, nor their growne naturall children from being ſubjects of this grace of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, to have the Spirit of grace and faith poured upon them by vertue of the Covenant. One onely place of all the reſt, might ſeem to look that way, which you quote out of <hi>John</hi> 3.5, 6, where it is ſaid that the carnall ſeed, as being fleſh, and deſtitute of the ſpirit, cannot enter into the Kingdom of God. And indeed if by the Kingdome of God, were meant the Church (as oftentimes it is)
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:113833:77"/> the objection would bee more difficult to reſolve. But the truth is, in that place, by the Kingdome of God, is plainly meant, the Kingdome of Glory, not the Church. For <hi>Nicodemus</hi> did not ſcruple his Church eſtate, nor enquire how hee might enter into the viſible Church, but how hee might bee ſaved, and inherit the Kingdome of Glory. And therefore Chriſt directeth him to Regeneration, and to beleeve in his Name, that hee might attain unto everlaſting life. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.5.14, 15, 16. And though hee ſpeak of water, as co-working with the Spirit in Regeneration, (ver. 5.) yet by water may either bee underſtood the Spirit it ſelf (as waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſoule like water, in Regeneration:) or, if Baptiſme bee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, yet it is not there conſidered, as a neceſſary ingredient to Church-fellowſhip, but as a neceſſary inſtrument of the Spirit, unto the ſealing up of Regeneration, the careleſſe neglect and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt whereof, would exclude from ſalvation, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.30.</p>
               <p>It would therefore ſeem a more reaſonable matter,<note place="margin">Silveſter.</note> to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Baptiſme to a perſon, when the ſpirit is in hand with his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation. But to what end ſhall Baptiſme bee adminiſtred to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, when wee doe not diſcern that the Spirit is about any ſuch work as the Regenration of them?</p>
               <p>It is no unwonted thing with God,<note place="margin">Silvanus.</note> to give that for a ſigne of a thing, which ſhall not bee accompliſhed of many dayes or yeers after. God gave the Rainbow for a ſign, that hee would no more deſtroy the world with water. The performance whereof remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſtill to bee accompliſhed to the end of the world. God gave two ſticks joyned together in <hi>Ezekiels</hi> hand, to bee a ſigne of the joyning together of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Joſeph</hi> in one ſtate, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.16. to 22. which is not yet accompliſhed, nor will bee till their laſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion. God gave Circumciſion to the Iſraelites, as a ſigne that hee would circumciſe their hearts, and the hearts of their ſeed, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.6. And yet ſometimes their own hearts, ſometimes the hearts of their ſeed were not circumciſed of many yeers after. It is enough that as in Circumciſion, ſo in Baptiſme, God ſealeth up that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and Covenant, which hee hath made to beleevers to bee a God to them and to their ſeed. For the preſent, according to Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant God preſerveth and nouriſheth the ſeed of the faithfull, by his Fatherly providence; God the Son as hee undertook to the Iſraelites, ſo hee hath already performed it to us, to ſhed his blood for us and our children; The holy Ghoſt (to whom it belongeth to work Regeneration) hee may take his own good time, ſooner
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:113833:78"/> or later to performe that work in our Children, which hee hath wrought in our ſelves. God is as faithfull in the New Teſtament, as in the Old: and Baptiſme which ſucceedeth Circumciſion in ſealing the ſame Covenant, will undoubtedly bee accompliſhed in applying all the bleſſings of the Covenant to us and our ſeed, as ever Circumciſion found accompliſhment to the Iſraelites and their ſeed.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Silveſter.</note>
                  <q>Although Baptiſme ſucceedeth Circumciſion, yet the difference is great, both in matter and manner, in perſons and things. Circumciſion ſealeth to things temporall and carnall, as well as ſpirituall: and ſo were the ſubjects and things to come, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der types and ſhadowes, and ſo in a cloud and darkneſſe: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Baptiſme hath for its ſubjects, children of the light, in the clear evidence of the Spirit, with the face open, and confirmes faith in things come and already done. For Baptiſme ſealeth onely to faith in Chriſt, and grace in the new Birth, which cannot bee where there is not firſt a begetting by the immortall ſeed of the Word of Life; for which end God hath ordained in the Goſpel, faith and beleeving to goe before Baptizing, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. with <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.15, 16. And that way and order, which hath not God for its Authour, and found in the Records of Chriſt, with his Image and ſuperſcription upon it, let us ſay, as ſometimes hee did, Give to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> that which is <hi>Caeſars,</hi> and to God, that which is Gods. So ſay I, give to Antichriſt, his baptizing of Infants: and to Chriſt, his baptizing of Beleevers. What advantage will it bee to Infants, to come before they bee called? to have a name to live, and yet dead for ought any one knows? and to come to the Marriage Supper without a wedding garment? Shall the holy things of God bee forced upon ſuch, as neither beleeve, know, or once deſire them? Will men ſet a ſeale to a blanck? Are Children capable to receive meat before they bee born? Except wee make Baptiſme the wombe of Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, as many doe, who teach that Infants are regenerated and born againe of the Spirit of Grace in Baptiſme: Whoſe Doctrine is of the ſame ſtampe and authority, as hee that ſent them ſo to Preach; What can be more naturall then the begetting or bringing forth of the Infant, before feeding of it at the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers breſts? Is it not ſacriledge to preſſe ſuch upon the Wife of Chriſt, the Church, for her Paps, with whom ſhee never travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, nor bare of her body? Chriſt will deny himſelf to bee food
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:113833:78"/> and nouriſhment to any, where hee hath not beene firſt ſeed to beget? Let men take heed how they impute ſuch folly to the wiſdome of God, as to give the milk of his breſts unto any that are ſtill-born; or to ſet dead twigges in his heavenly and divine ſtock, or naturall branches into his holy and ſpirituall Vine. Let ſuch beware, how they fight againſt the God of Order, leſt inſtead of finding the breſts to feed, before the womb to beare, they meet with a curſe upon the ſingle emptineſſe of Chriſt, with a double barrenneſſe, that will admit of no conception, or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall birth, to ſucceed the naturall. Not that I intend in the leaſt, to deny ſalvation unto Infants; no, I am ſo far from this, that I teſtify againſt all ſuch Doctrine: nor yet affirm all Infants to bee ſaved: neither doe I know among Infants which ſhall be ſaved, and which not; Therefore I leave it as a ſecret thing to God, untill hee make the ſame appeare by ſome viſible act of Faith, which onely giveth a viſible right, unto any Ordinance of the New Teſtament. And therefore I cannot ſee by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel how Infants voyd of viſible Faith, ſhould have viſible right to the Priviledges of Grace; neither ought they to bee admitted thereunto.</q>
               </p>
               <p>You have ſeen by the Goſpel, that the bleſſing of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Silvanus.</note> is come upon the beleeving Gentiles: and that the bleſſing of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was that Covenant (or Promiſe of Grace) that God would bee a God to him and to his ſeed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that his ſeed, was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpirituall Chriſtians, for they are beleevers themſelves, but the ſeed of beleevers: Now beleevers are one thing, and the ſeed of beleevers is an other; they are two diſtinct ſubjects of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. And ſeeing the Covenant of God hath diſtinguiſhed them, who are you, that you ſhould confound them? What if Infants bee void, as you ſay, of viſible Faith? yet their right to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and to the ſeale of the Covenant, is, or ought to bee viſible to all men. For it is viſible they are the children of beleevers: and it is viſible that the Covenant is given to beleevers, and to their ſeed; whether they ſhall bee ſaved or no, it is not required that it ſhould bee viſible: but let it bee (as you ſay it is) a ſecret thing to God, yet God hath made it viſibly (ſhall I ſay; or audibly?) to appear that hee accounteth them holy (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14.) and that of ſuch is his Kingdome (<hi>Mar.</hi> 10.14.) whoſe divine teſtimony of them is as clear an evidence to us, that God giveth them right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fellowſhip of the Church, and to the ſeal thereof, as the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:113833:79"/> teſtimony of men can give unto themſelves or others, by their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball profeſſion, or any other viſible effects of Faith. <q>Doe not ſay, that you are farre from denying in the leaſt meaſure, ſalvation unto Infants.</q>
               </p>
               <p>For if Infants dye in their Infancy, you have apparently decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it above, that you doe not acknowledge them to bee ſubjects <q>capable either of election to grace and glory, or of Union with Chriſt, or the Covenant of Grace.</q> And then, how wee ſhould beleeve you (when you ſay you doe not in the leaſt meaſure deny ſalvation to Infants, and yet deny all ſuch meanes of ſalvation, without which it is impoſſible, they ſhould bee ſaved) judge you.</p>
               <p>But to come to the ground you work upon in denying to them Baptiſm, whereas Circumciſion was granted to them of old, and in both a promiſe of ſalvation ſealed up to them, untill they came to reject it.</p>
               <p>Though Baptiſme (you conceive) ſucceed Circumciſion, yet you put a great difference between them, both in matter and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, "in perſons and things.</p>
               <p>And what might that great difference bee in ſo many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars?</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Circumciſion (ſay you) ſealed to things temporall and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, as well as to ſpirituall, and ſo were the ſubjects (carnall, as well as ſpirituall:) Baptiſme onely ſealeth to Faith in Chriſt, and to Grace in the New Birth.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I pray you doth not Baptiſme ſeale to the Covenant of Grace, as well as Circumciſion, in whoſe room it ſucceedeth? And doth not the Covenant of Grace contain promiſes of temporall, and carnall (or outward) bleſſings, as well as ſpirituall? <hi>Hoſe.</hi> 2.18.21, 22, 23. Hath not godlineſſe in the New Teſtament (as well as in the Old) the Promiſes of this life, as well as that which is to come? 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. Doth not Baptiſme expreſſely ſeale up unto us, our deliverance out of Affliction, as well as out of corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? yea, to the raiſing up of our bodies out of death in the grave, as well as of our ſoules out of the death in ſin? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.29. It is therefore utterly untrue, that Baptiſme ſealeth onely to Faith in Chriſt, and to grace in the New Birth; For it ſealeth to all the bleſſings of the Covenant, as well thoſe of this life, as of that which is to come. That which ſealeth to this grand bleſſing of the Covenant, that God will bee a God to ſuch or ſuch, ſealeth
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:113833:79"/> unto all other gifts of God alſo. God never giveth himſelf alone, but hee giveth his Son and his Spirit alſo. And hee that giveth us his own Sonne (ſaith the Apoſtle) ſhall hee not with him give us all things elſe alſo? <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. Yea, where Chriſt is given hee giveth Repentance unto <hi>Iſrael</hi> and converſion (or turning) of the hearts of the Fathers to the Children, and of the Children to the Fathers, and both of them to the Lord. <hi>Act.</hi> 5.31. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.16, 17. And Baptiſme is a ſeale of theſe promiſes, as of the whole Covenant. And therefore Baptiſme is not onely (as you ſay) a ſeale to Faith, and to the Grace of the New Birth, as if it onely confirmed our own Faith touching our own eſtates, and our own New Birth: But it confirmeth alſo our Faith, that God will give Faith and Repentance to our Children, and turn their hearts both to the Lord and to us. And therefore hee powreth the water of Baptiſme upon our Children, that hee may confirme this promiſe of Grace, the powring out of clean water, of his Spirit, and of his bleſſing, as well upon our ſeed and off-ſpring, as upon our ſelves, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 44.3.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Another difference which you put, is, that Circumciſion ſealeth to things to come, as under Types and ſhadowes, and ſo to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in a cloud, and darkneſſe: whereas Baptiſme confirmeth Faith in things come, and already done: and hath for its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects Children of the light, in the clear evidence of the Spirit, with face open:</q> Suppoſe this difference were true: That Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion ſealed to things to come: and Baptiſme to things come: Circumciſion to things vailed, Baptiſme to things open: Yet this is but a circumſtantiall difference, in the manner of revealing the bleſſings promiſed: but this argueth no materiall difference at all in the perſons, the ſubjects of the ſeale. It will onely argue thus much, that whereas the ſame Chriſt, and the things of Chriſt were ſealed up to them, and to their ſeed more darkly, they are ſealed up to us and our ſeed, more clearly and plainly.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Beſides, it is not altogether true, that Circumciſion ſealed up to them things to come.</q> For both Baptiſme and Circumciſion doe ſeale to both things come, and things to come. Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſealed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> God to bee his God, and the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Faith: both which were already come to <hi>Abraham</hi> before hee was circumciſed. It ſealed up alſo ſundry things to come, to him, and his ſeed, as their deliverance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> their inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the comming of the Meſſiah. But when
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:113833:80"/> the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> came to enjoy <hi>Canaan,</hi> Circumciſion did not then ſeal to their deliverance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> or to their inheritance of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> as things to come, but as to things come, and already done. Circumciſion ſealed to the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that God would circumciſe their hearts, and the hearts of their ſeed, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6. which was a thing to come, to ſuch of them as were unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. But after they were Regenerate, the ſame Circumciſion was a ſeale of that bleſſing, which God had already done for them. So is it with Baptiſme: Now that Chriſt is come in the fleſh, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme ſealeth that to us, as a thing already done, which to them was a thing to come. And yet the comming of Chriſt into our hearts, is a thing partly done in the Regenerate, and yet more fully to bee done, even to us: and to many of our children, it is a thing to come. To the children of God that walk in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſee no light, (which is the caſe of many, and at ſome time or other, of all) the return of the Comforter, is a thing to come, and Baptiſme is a ſeale thereof: and yet it is a ſeale alſo of the firſt fruites of the Spirit, which are already come. Baptiſm is a ſeale of the Redemption of Chriſt, which is already wrought for us. And it is a ſeale of our deliverance from all afflictions, and from all temptations and from all corruptions, and from all ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, even from death it ſelf, and many of theſe are yet to come. So that I can but wonder why ſuch a difference as this ſhould bee alleged to prove a perſonall difference of the ſubjects of Baptiſm, and the ſubjects of Circumciſion.</p>
               <p>If it bee ſaid (as you partly expreſſe, and partly imply) that <q>wee who live under Baptiſme are the children of light, but they that lived under Circumciſion, were the children of darkneſſe, and therefore though their children being in darkneſſe, in ſuch a dark time, might bee capable of Circumciſion, yet in the light of the Goſpel our children are not capable of Baptiſme, till they become children of light;</q> This is a carnall reaſoning, not ſavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Spirit of God, or ſpeaking the language of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. For though the Spirit of God in Scripture do call the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God the children of light, in oppoſition to their former carnall eſtate, whether in their Pagancy, or in their unregeneracy (1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.5. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5 8.) yet God never called the children of God in the Old Teſtament, nor the children of his children, children of darkneſſe: Neither doth hee uſe ſuch a phraſe, as to call the children of the New Teſtament, children of the light, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:113833:80"/> to the children of the Old Teſtament, as children of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. <q>Neither is it altogether a true ſpeech, that faith in Chriſt, and grace in the new birth, cannot bee where there is not firſt a begetting by the immortall ſeed of the word of life.</q> For it hath been ſhewed above, that the grace of the new birth, and ſo faith, were not wanting in <hi>John Baptiſt, Jeremy,</hi> and others, in their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wombe, who yet had never heard the Word of life. Though the hearing of the Word of life bee the ordinary inſtrument, which the Spirit of God is wont to uſe in begetting the grace of the new birth in men of underſtanding: yet the Spirit himſelfe being a principall part of the immortall ſeed of the Word, hee can beget the grace of the new birth without the Word, when yet the Word cannot doe it without him. And yet I will not deny that in ſome ſenſe (though not in yours) it may be granted, that the Spirit ordinarily never worketh the grace of the new birth in the children of the faithfull, but by the immortall ſeed of the Word of life. For when the Spirit begetteth the grace of the new birth, it is by the Miniſtery of the Word of life to their Parents, one of them at leaſt. For they hearing the Word of life promiſing grace and life to themſelves, and to their ſeed, the Spirit co-working with that Word, begetteth faith in them to believe for themſelves, and for their ſeed. And according to their faith, it is done. The Spirit begetteth the grace of life, as well in their ſeed, as in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The greater is the danger of thoſe infants whoſe Parents (like you) doe not beleeve the grace of Chriſt can reach unto your infants; and ſo it is no wonder, if your children be deprived of the grace of the new birth, for your unbeliefs ſake. Be it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore granted which you take for granted in your next words; <q>That for this end (to wit, for begetting the grace of the new birth) God hath ordained in the Goſpel preaching and believing to goe before baptizing, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.9. with <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.15, 16.</q> yet this only proveth that the preaching of the Goſpel, and the begetting of faith by the Goſpel is requiſite to enſtate the hearer in the grace and bleſſing, or (which is all one) in the Covenant of the Goſpel. But if the hearer be a Parent of children, and ſo doe believe the Goſpel and Covenant of grace to belong to him and to his ſeed; both hee and they according to the order of the Goſpel, and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, are rightly baptized into the name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the Holy Ghoſt. All which perſons do joyne together in making this Covenant, and ſealing to it, to be a
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:113833:81"/> God to the believer and his ſeed. And if it were not ſo, the place which you quote out of <hi>Mark</hi> (Chap. 16. <hi>v.</hi> 15, 16.) would utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cut off the children of believers dying in their infancy, from all hope of ſalvation: which you ſaid even now, you were far from. For if infants for want of hearing the Word in their owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons want faith, and for want of faitſh may not bee baptized, then for want of faith they cannot be ſaved. For ſo run the words in <hi>Marke,</hi> He that believeth and is baptized ſhall be ſaved, hee that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth not ſhall be damned. If for unbeliefe they muſt not be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, for unbeliefe they muſt then bee damned. But if by the Goſpel we underſtand (as the Scriptures meane) the glad tydings of the Covenant of grace, and ſo of redemption and ſalvation by Chriſt preached and proclaimed to believers and their ſeed, then al ſuch as doe believe theſe glad tydings, to themſelves and to their ſeed, they are commanded by the Order of the Goſpel to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed themſelves, and their children with them; for their children are by the faith of their Parents wrapped up in the Covenant, and ſo are become capable ſubjects both of the Covenant, and of the ſeale thereof. For though the infants themſelves be not (it may be) then actually believers, when their Parents are baptized, and themſelves with them; yet God who calleth things that are not, as though they were <hi>Rom</hi> 4.17. He accepteth them into his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant by the faith of their Parents, and ſo they are no longer Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans and infidells, but the children of the faithfull and holy, in whom God hath covenanted to worke faith, and the grace of the new birth in the elect ſeed, and to offer it, and the meanes thereof unto all the ſeed, till they utterly reject it: And requireth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the Parents by his Covenant, to neglect no meanes of grace for the holy inſtitution of their children. And for this end the ſeale of the Covenant is adminiſtred to the Infants to confirme the ſame to their children on both parts.</p>
               <p>If therefore we delighted in returning reproaches for reproaches, <q>as you ſay to us, give the baptizing of believers to Chriſt, and the baptizing of infants unto Antichriſt, ſo might we more tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and juſtly returne it to you:</q> Give the baptizing of believers and their ſeed unto Chriſt; (For the Covenant of Chriſt is to belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and their ſeed, and the ſeale of the Covenant is due, where the faith of either Parent is fit to receive it to their holy ſeed;) but give the denyall of baptiſme of Infants to Infidels onely, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laws from the Church, where neither of their Parents being belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:113833:81"/> their children alſo are Infidels and outlawes like their Parents, neither believers, nor holy according to Covenant; You need not "therefore ask what advantage will it be to Infants to come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they bee called? For Chriſt called for little children to come unto him, and was diſpleaſed with ſuch as did forbid them, <hi>Marke</hi> 10.14. If calling for Infants to come, will ſuffice, they cannot bee ſaid to come before they be called. Suffer (ſaith he) little children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of ſuch is the Kingdom of God. And they being ſuch, hee put his hands upon them and bleſſed them. If you ask, why he did not baptize them too, for who can forbid Baptiſme to ſuch as are bleſſed of Chriſt, and by impoſition of hands ſet apart to a bleſſing, and to the Kingdome of God? I would anſwer, Jeſus himſelfe baptized none, <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.2. If you aske againe, but why did not hee command his Diſciples to baptiz: them? I anſwer, becauſe it may be both they and their children were baptized before: Or becauſe it doth not appeare, that their Parents came to bee baptized of him; or had themſelves been baptized before, though out of a godly affection they brought their children to him that he might bleſſe them. Now it was not meet, that the children ſhould bee baptized, when neither of the Parents of any of them were baptized, nor brought their children to ſuch an end. Though we baptize children, yet we doe not give them, (as you ſay) a name to live when they bee dead. For they may be truly ſaid to live in that ſenſe, wherein the dead bodies of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> are ſaid to live to him, <hi>Luke</hi> 20.37, 38. For though they were then dead in their graves, yet God being the God of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> by Covenant; hee will therefore raiſe up their dead bodies to life againe. And ſo it is with the Infants of believers, though they were by nature dead in ſinne, yet God (the God of their Fathers) being a God to them by vertue of the Covenant, ſeeing God is not the God of the dead, but of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, God will therefore according to his Covenant, raiſe them up to newneſſe of life, that they may live in his ſight; If any of them fall ſhort of that life, it is becauſe they make themſelves twice dead, by caſting off the Covenant of their fathers.</p>
               <p>I marvaile why you ſhould call the baptiſme of Infants a com-"ming to the marriage ſupper without a wedding Garment. If you meane by comming to the marriage Supper, partaking of the Lords Table; you are not ignorant, there is great difference in this caſe, between the Lords Supper and Baptiſme, ſuch may bee admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:113833:82"/> to Baptiſm, as may not be admitted to the Lords Supper. We do not force (as you call it) the holy things of God upon ſuch as nei-"ther believe, nor know, nor once deſire them. For if Parents doe not willingly offer their children to Baptiſme, we doe not force them. And if they bring them, and prefent them to Chriſt, Chriſt accepteth the Parents bringing of them, as much as the childrens comming in their own perſon, <hi>Mar.</hi> 10.13, 14.</p>
               <p>Why ſhould you call the Baptiſme of infants the ſettting of a "ſeal unto a blank?</p>
               <p>Is the Covenant of God to believing Parents and their ſeed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a blanke? Is the promiſe of pouring out the Spirit of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration upon the ſeed and off-ſpring of believers a blank? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.3. But it ſeemeth by your opinion, if our children bee not full of themſelves, all the promiſes of God are a blanke and empty to them.</p>
               <p>Though children be not capable to receive meat before they bee borne; yet their Parents who are borne againe, had need of ſome ſign (the ſign appointed of God) to feed and ſtrengthen their faith in the Covenant, that God will bee a God to them and their ſeed.</p>
               <p>Beſides, the Baptiſme which children receive before their rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration is a ſeale and confirmation of the Covenant, and of all the promiſes thereof to them, after their regeneration. The Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion which <hi>David</hi> received in his infancy, did confirme his faith and confidence of victory againſt <hi>Goliah</hi> (the uncircumciſed Philiſtine) after he was grown up to mans eſtate, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17 26. Signs given of God for future bleſſings are neither blanks, nor prepoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</p>
               <p>We doe not make baptiſme (as you ſay) the wombe of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, nor teach, that Infants are regenerated and borne of the Spirit of grace in Baptiſme.</p>
               <p>Nor doe I finde that it was their judgement, who compyled that book where ſuch words are uſed; men may thankfully acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a benefit as received, when they have onely received a promiſe of it, and ſee it confirmed with a ſigne; when <hi>Gedeon</hi> received a ſigne of the accompliſhment of Gods promiſed victory over the <hi>Midianites,</hi> though that ſigne was but a dreame, and of a bleſſing to come, yet <hi>Gedeon</hi> thankfully worſhipped God for it, and accepted the Victory as already granted him. For ſo ſaith the Text, <hi>Judg.</hi> 7.15. When <hi>Gedeon</hi> heard the telling of the dreame, and the interpretation of the dreame, hee worſhipped and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:113833:82"/> into the Hoſt of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſaid, Ariſe, for the Lord hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered into your hand the Hoſt of <hi>Midian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>It is to no purpoſe to ask us (as you doe) what can bee more naturall, then begetting and bringing forth of the Infant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore feeding of it at the Mothers breſts? Is it not ſacriledge to preſſe ſuch upon the Pappes of the Wife of Chriſt (his Church) with whom ſhee never travelled, or bare of her body?</q>
               </p>
               <p>For wee doe not look at the Sacraments, neither doth the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture take them, as the breſts, or Paps of the Church; The wit of man can make an Image to it ſelfe, and then play before it, as the Iſraelites did before the golden Calfe. Twice doth the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture mention the breſts of the Church, and never meaneth them for the Sacraments, but for the Miniſters of the Church, full of the ſincere milk of the Word, equall in Office (as the breſts hoin bigneſſe) and ſuch as doe themſelves feed among Lillyes, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.5. and 7.3. and 8.10. You muſt ſtrain your wit farre, to make the breſts of the Church agree to the Sacraments, Baptiſme is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Navell of the Church, whereby the Infant hath nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment derived to it before it bee born, <hi>Cant.</hi> 7.2. And as for the Lords Supper, if it bee the other of the two breſts of the Church, the oldeſt and ſtrongeſt Chriſtians had ſtill need to ſuck of that breſt; and ſo muſt become againe babes in Chriſt. Yea Baptiſme it ſelf, though it bee a ſeale of Regeneration whether paſt, or to come, yet it ſealeth up alſo ſuch deliverance from afflictions, and perſecutions, (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3 21.) and ſuch ſanctification, and cleanſing from all ſin, to preſent us to Chriſt without ſpot or wrinckle (<hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ.</hi> 5.26, 27.) that the ſtrongeſt Chriſtian will have need to feed upon his Baptiſme (as ſtrong meat for ſtrong men) even when he is to lay down his body in the duſt, and to expect from his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme the reſurrection of his body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.29.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>But, ſay you, Chriſt will deny himſelf to bee nouriſhment to any, where hee hath not been firſt ſeed to beget.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Though none can take any nouriſhment, till they bee begotten. No Prince will deny to give a Charter to a Corporation of his Subject; (and a Charter ſealed with the Great Seale) of ſuch and ſuch Lands, and inheritances, for the maintenance and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment of them, and their children, and their childrens children for ever, before any children bee yet born to them.</p>
               <p>Your exhortations therefore, for want of a ground-work of Truth, doe fall of themſelves to the ground, like an houſe built upon the Sand.</p>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:113833:83"/>
               <p>
                  <q>Let men take heed (ſay you) how they impute ſuch folly to the wiſdome of God, as to give the milk of his breſts, to any that are ſtill-born.</q>
               </p>
               <p>For neither are all the Infants of the faithfull Parents ſtill-born (I mean, in reſpect of ſpirituall life,) and if they were, yet Baptiſme is not called in Scripture Gods milk: and if it were reſembled to milk, yet it is not milk onely, but it ſerveth for many other uſes. It is a ſeale of that Covenant, whereby God promiſeth both to bee ſeed, and milk, and ſtrong meat, and medicine, and all in all, unto beleevers and their children.</p>
               <p>Your next exhortation, to take heed how wee ſet dead twigges in his heavenly and divine ſtock, or naturall branches in his holy and ſpirituall Vine, it hath received Anſwer above; you have heard before, that dead perſons if in Covenant, are alive to God, <hi>Luk.</hi> 20.37, 38. And though a twigge cannot receive life from the ſtock unleſſe it bring life with it before it be engraffed: yet Chriſt can give life to dead branches that are put to him, as well as the dead corps of <hi>Eliſha</hi> could give life to the dead man caſt into his grave, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 13.21.</p>
               <p>Your third exhortation hath as little ground as either of the former.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Let men beware (ſay you) how they fight againſt the God of Order, leſt in ſtead of finding the breſt to feed, before the womb to bear, they meet with a curſe upon the ſingle emptineſſe of Chriſt, with a double barrenneſſe, that will admit of no ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall birth to ſucceed the Naturall.</q>
               </p>
               <p>If you will needs have Baptiſme to bee the breſt of the Church, I will not contend with you: for there is in it alſo ſome milk for babes, as well as there is much ſtrong meat in it for men of riper yeers. But when wee doe bring Infants to Baptiſme, wee doe not firſt finde the breſt to feed them, before wee finde the wombe to bear them. For the Apoſtle maketh the two Covenants the two Mothers, of which all the children of the Church are born, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Old or New Teſtament, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.22, 23, 24. If then wee have found Infants to bee in the Covenant, wee have found a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and in her, a wombe to bear them. And if wee bring none to Baptiſme, but ſuch as are the children of the Covenant, then wee doe not finde a breſt to feed them, before a womb to breed and beare them. But wee proceed Orderly (even according to the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, and the ancient Order, which hee hath ſet in his
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:113833:83"/> Church) wee firſt finde a wombe to breed and bear them, and then a breſt to nouriſh and feed them. The curſe therefore which you threaten, is cauſeleſſe, and being cauſeleſſe will not come, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.2.</p>
               <p>Thus by the help of Chriſt, our Arguments for the Baptiſme of Infants, have been at laſt cleared from your exceptions, from ſo many of them at leaſt, as you have made againſt them hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Now (if you pleaſe) let us inquire into your Arguments (if you have any) againſt the Baptiſme of Infants.</p>
               <p>Yes,<note place="margin">Silveſter.</note> I have divers Arguments (eight or nine) againſt the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme of Infants, <q>beſides many evill conſequences, which I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, will follow unavoydably upon the Baptiſme of Infants.</q>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The firſt that I have met withall is that (whereto you have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſpoken in part) becauſe there is neither command,<note place="margin">Silveſter.</note> nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in all the New Teſtament for the baptizing of Infants. And yet the Order and Government of the New Teſtament in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration thereof, is no way inferiour to the Old. But in the Old Teſtament there was an expreſſe Rule, by Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from God, what Communicants were to bee admitted to Circumciſion, and other Ordinances of that nature, and what not. But this Order is no where found in the New Teſtament for the baptizing of Infants, and therefore the ſame is not to bee practiſed.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To this Argument you have received an Anſwer already:<note place="margin">Silvanus.</note> when in the beginning of our conference, I gave you three grounds for the Baptiſme of Infants: the two former from the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt, and of his Apoſtle in the New Teſtament: the third from the Old and New Teſtament together, gathered from the Analogy of Circumciſion and Baptiſme. The Commandement of Chriſt was cleared from <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19, 20. The Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Apoſtle was opened from <hi>Acts</hi> 2.39. The Analogy of Circumciſion and Baptiſme, was urged from <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. with <hi>Col.</hi> 2.11, 12.</p>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:113833:84"/>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Silveſter.</note>I have already acquainted you with the ſumme of thoſe excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which I have met withall, againſt all the Arguments which you have alledged for the grounding of the Baptiſme of Infants upon any word of Commandement or Inſtitution from Chriſt and his Apoſtles. Onely one exception further commeth to my minde againſt your third Argument, taken from the Analogy of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion and Baptiſme.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Suppoſe that the Covenant of God with <hi>Abraham,</hi> wherein hee promiſeth to bee a God to him and his ſeed doe continue to beleevers and our ſeed now in the dayes of the New Teſtament: Suppoſe alſo that Baptiſme doe ſucceed Circumciſion: yet as it was not the promiſe of God to <hi>Abraham</hi> that was a ſufficient ground of Circumciſion, but Gods word of Commandement, (or elſe it would have been ſin to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to have circumciſed his ſeed:) ſo neither is it the promiſe and Covenant of God to beleevers, to bee a God to us, and our ſeed, that can bee a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ground to us of baptizing our Infants.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Silvanus.</note>I did make account, this exception had been prevented above, as well as the reſt. For wee doe not ground the Baptiſme of Infants meerly upon the promiſe of grace, that God is a God to us and our ſeed: but upon the Commandement of God, that they to whom God is a God, by Covenant, they ſhould receive the ſeale of the Covenant. Which Commandement was (as you know) expreſſely given to <hi>Abraham:</hi> and thereupon hee circumciſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his ſeed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.10, 11. If then the ſame Covenant bee now given to the faithfull and our ſeed, and if Baptiſme bee given to us in ſtead of Circumciſion, then the ſame Commandement which required <hi>Abraham</hi> to bee circumciſed and his ſeed, requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to bee baptized and our ſeed. And indeed upon this very ground the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> urgeth every one of them who repented, to bee baptized, they and their ſeed, becauſe the promiſe was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to them and their ſeed. The ſtrength of which Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his, lay in the Commandement of God to faithfull <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> to bee circumciſed and his ſeed, and the ſubſtitution of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme now in the room of Circumciſion. And verely there is the ſame morall equity, and reaſon of the Commandement, both to faithfull Iſraelites, and faithfull Chriſtians. For as the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed, confirmed the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that God would bee a God to him and his ſeed: And alſo enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <hi>Abraham,</hi> both himſelf to walk in the obedience of Gods will,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:113833:84"/> and to traine up his children to walke accordingly; ſo the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of the new Teſtament ſtand in the like need to have their faith confirmed, that God will bee a God to us and our ſeed: And we are in like ſort engaged both to walke in Gods wayes our ſelves, and to bring up our children in the like holy inſtruction and information of the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>But let it be examined a little,<note place="margin">Silveſter.</note> how the authority of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of Circumciſion can beare out the authority of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing infants. Circumciſion it doth not; for all agree that wee are now to baptize, not to circumciſe. The Miniſter circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it doth not; then the Maſter of the family was to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, now one ordained by Chriſt in the Church to baptize. The ſame part of the body it doth not; that circumciſed the foreskin, Baptiſme the whole man. The age it doth not; that the eighth day, this any day. The ſubject it doth not; that a male onely, this both male and female. Now in that it doth not enjoyne any of all theſe: wherein then can the authority of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement conſiſt now in Baptiſme, ſo as to enjoyne Infants to be baptized? And whereas men cry out from that command, that Infants, Infants, Infants muſt be baptized, as they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to bee circumciſed: Why, this commandement, if it ſhould be ſo, ſerves for none but onely males. So that if they will have the females to be baptized, they muſt looke out another commandement for them, and ſo there muſt be two commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in one Ordinance.</q>

               <p>There is no inconvenience for two commandements to meet in one Ordinance. Circumciſion was more then once commanded,<note place="margin">Silvanus.</note> (<hi>Gen.</hi> 17. <hi>Lev.</hi> 12.) So was the Paſſeover, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12 <hi>Numb.</hi> 9. <hi>Levit.</hi> 23.5. Neither is it another commandement that wee alledge for the baptizing of females, but onely an example, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.12. which yet being precedentiall, is of like force as a commandement; look wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in wee vary in the adminiſtration of Baptiſme from the Rite and manner of Circumciſion, wee have juſt warrant for it in the New Teſtament. Elſe we ſhould no more have varyed from it, then did the Proſelytes of the Old Teſtament. The rite of Circumciſing, and of the foreskin, is expreſly aboliſhed, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.2. And we are ſaid now to be circumciſed in being baptized, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.11, 12. The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Circumciſion, if it were not removed in the Old Teſtament from the family to the Synagogue, from the father of the family to the Levite; yet ſurely removed it was by Chriſt, to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:113833:85"/> of the Goſpel, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. The age had ſomething in it ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall, as hath been ſhewed above. The ſex (or ſubject, as you call it) was enlarged by the example of <hi>Philip, Acts</hi> 8.12. So that we vary in nothing from the Commandement of circumciſion, but by the like warrant whereby Circumciſion was at firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. Shew us the like warrant for the rejecting of infants from Baptiſme, as we ſhew you for the changing of all the reſt, and reaſon will require we ſhould hearken to you.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Tell us not, that <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> baptized ſuch as profeſſed their faith and repentance; and <hi>Philip</hi> baptized the Eunuch upon the profeſſion of his faith.</q>
               </p>
               <p>For we doe alſo now require the like from Proſelytes or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts of grown yeares, whether Jewes or Pagans. But ſhew us any ground from Scripture (either out of the Old or New Teſtament) whereby infants are excluded either from the Covenant, or from the ſeale of the Covenant, and then we ſhall plead no longer for the Baptiſme of infants from the Analogie of Circumciſion.</p>

But neither of both theſe will ſtand with the Apoſtles words, nor ſcope. His ſcope is to diſpute not againſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants to exclude them from being ſubjects of the Church: but to exclude legall Juſticiaries (ſuch as deſired to be under the law) from being children of the Covenant of grace. The words of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle are theſe: The two Mothers, are the two Covenants, <hi>v.</hi> 24. not the old ſtate of the Church in the Old Teſtament, and the new ſtate of the Church in the New Teſtament; <hi>Hagar</hi> is Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> in <hi>Arabia,</hi> (ſaith he) and anſwereth (or ſtandeth in the ſame rank, as the word ſignifieth) to <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> that now is, <hi>v.</hi> 25. Marke that I pray you, hee ſaith, not to <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> in her old eſtate, in the dayes of the godly Kings, and holy Prieſts, and Prophets, and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (the Saints of the Lord who looked to bee ſaved by the grace of Chriſt, as well as we, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.11.) but to <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> that now is, under the corrupt and degenerate Prieſts and Rulers, Scribes, Phariſees, and Sadduces, who renounced Chriſt, and the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of faith in him, and ſeek to eſtabliſh their owne righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe which is by the law. And though ſome of them received Chriſt, (as did the falſe Teachers in the Churches of <hi>Galatia</hi>) and did alſo acknowledge their freedome from the ſacrifices and burnt offerings, and from many other Leviticall Ceremonies of the Law, yet ſo long as they looked to be juſtified by the works of the moral law, and retained circumciſion as ſtill neceſſary by the law, they ſtill pertained to <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> that now is (as the Apoſtle calleth it) and all of them were children of the bond-woman, that is, of the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:113833:86"/> Covenant of the Law given on Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> It is therefore a groſſe error, and withall a notorious injury to the godly Saints that lived in the dayes of the Old Teſtament, to account them the children of <hi>Hagar,</hi> and to make it a part of their bondage, that their Infants were received into the fellowſhip of the Church with themſelves. No, no, whilſt themſelves believed in the promiſed ſeed for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and ſalvation, and their children were circumciſed into the grace of the Covenant (the righteouſneſſe of faith) they and their ſeed were accounted the children of the Covenant of grace, (the free-woman) till any of them rejected that grace, as <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> did.</p>
               <p>By this which hath been ſaid, may eaſily bee underſtood, what is meant by <hi>Sarah:</hi> not the ſtate of the Church of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (as you confine it, rather then define it) but the Covenant of Grace, by which God (of his Grace) gave himſelfe to bee a God to beleevers and to their ſeed, both in the Old and New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, till any of them ſhould afterwards grow up to renounce him, and the Grace of his Covenant, which if they doe, then their Circumciſion is made uncircumciſion: and they renouncing the Covenant of Grace, fall under the Covenant of the Law, and come to bee accurſed by the Law.</p>
               <p>But for the children of this Covenant (of whom <hi>Iſaac</hi> was a type) they are not onely ſuch as are Regenerate, above the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary courſe of Nature, by vertue of the Covenant of Grace, and ſo doe beleeve in the promiſe of Grace for righteouſneſſe and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; but alſo the children of ſuch beleeving Parents, whom their Parents doe beget in the Faith of the Covenant and Promiſe of Grace to themſelves and their ſeed. For <hi>Iſaac</hi> himſelf when he was an Infant born, hee was not as then born anew of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and ſpirit of Grace, but his Father begot him in the Faith of the Promiſe. And his Mother <hi>Sarah</hi> by Faith received ſtrength to conceive ſeed, becauſe ſhee judged him faithfull who had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.11.</p>
               <p>The ſecond main pillar upon which your gloſſe on this Text, is <q>held up, is, that the two ſons, <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> type out the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſubjects of theſe two ſtates of Churches: <hi>Iſhmael</hi> being a type of the eſtate in generall of the Church of the old Teſtament, and <hi>Iſaac</hi> being a type of the ſtate of the Churches of the New Teſtament.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But neither will this gloſſe ſtand with the Apoſtles words. For
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:113833:86"/> the Apoſtle maketh theſe two ſons to bee the children engendred (or bred) of theſe two Mothers.

Onely thus much further I will not ſtick to grant you, That as the two Covenants are the two mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that are repreſented by <hi>Hagar</hi> and <hi>Sarah;</hi> ſo thoſe Churches that are begotten and bred of either of theſe Covenants, (and ſo are themſelves the children of the one, or of the other of theſe Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants) they may be ſaid to bee the mothers of thoſe particular members, which by their Miniſtery are engendred and bred; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the carnall ſeed of the Covenant of the Law, or of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſeed of the Covenant of Grace. For in the Hebrew language, any whole Society is called a mother, and the particular members thereof are called children, ſons or daughters. And this may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:113833:87"/> further help to cleare the words and meaning of the Apoſtle in this place. For the Apoſtle here maketh the Covenant of the Law to anſwer to <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> that now is, <hi>v.</hi> 25. as if ſo bee the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of the law, and the Church of the preſent <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> which ſtood for the Covenant of the law, were both <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, of one rank, and either of them might be called an <hi>Hagar,</hi> a mother ingende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their children unto bondage. And indeed the Church en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendereth and breedeth her children, by diſpenſing and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring the ſeed of that Covenant, of which themſelves are begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. In like manner the Apoſtle maketh the other mother <hi>Sarah,</hi> the Covenant of grace to be all one with the true Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which he calleth the <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> which is above, and maketh her the mother of us all, <hi>v.</hi> 26. Becauſe though ſhee bee her ſelfe begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and bred of the Covenant of grace, yet ſhee diſpenſing and adminiſtring the ſame ſpirituall ſeed, begetteth children like her ſelf, partakers of the lib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rty of the ſons of God.</p>
               <p>And yet to adde a word more (which may tend further to clear the words and meaning of the Apoſtle) as this ſeed of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, diſpenſed and adminiſtred by true and pure Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, is rightly called ſpirituall ſeed, in which the Spirit of grace delighteth to breath and worke; and therefore they that are begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of it, are ſaid to be borne after the Spirit: So the ſeed of the Covenant of the Law, is rightly called ſeed, as that which leaveth men that are begotten of it more carnall then they were before. For it either puffeth them up to a carnall confidence of their owne ſtrength and righteouſneſſe, or elſe ſinketh them into an horrible pit of diffidence and deſperation. And therefore they that are begotten of it, are rightly and fitly ſaid to be borne after the fleſh. And that is the very true meaning of the Apoſtles words, <hi>Gal</hi> 4.29. As it was then, ſo is it now: He that was borne after the fleſh, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted him that was borne after the Spirit. Where by ſuch as are "borne after the fleſh, the Apoſtle doth not mean (as you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand him) ſuch as are born by an ordinary courſe of nature, in a way of a naturall generation; but ſuch as are bred and begotten of the carnall ſeed of the Covenant of the law; which as it begot in <hi>Iſhmael</hi> a carnall confidence of his own ſtrength (or elſe he would never have ſleighted and mocked the promiſed ſeed:) ſo it begot in <hi>Cain,</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> an utter deſpaire of grace and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Thus then you ſee (I hope) at the length a true and juſt anſwer
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:113833:87"/> unto your firſt argument againſt the Baptiſme of Infants, taken from the ſuppoſed want of command or example of the baptizing of Infants in all the New Teſtament. By that which you have heard, it appeareth to the contrary, that the Baptiſme of Infants hath not wanted a commandement from Chriſt in the inſtitution of Baptiſme, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. nor a commandement from the Apoſtle (joyned with an example) in the firſt ſolemne adminiſtration of Baptiſme, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. nor a commandement and example from the Lord God in the inſtitution of a proportionall ſeale of the ſame Covenant, in the dayes of <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17. which though you ſeem to undervalue, becauſe it is fetched out of the Old Teſtament; yet be not you deceived by the equivocation of the name. For the Old and New Teſtament is ſometimes put for the Covenants of the Law, and of grace, (as <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.24, 25.) ſometimes for the Books of the Old and New Teſtament, as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.14. Now true it is, that the inſtitution of the Covenant of grace, and of the ſeale of the Covenant of grace, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. is found indeed in the bookes of the Old Teſtament; but the ſubſtance of the New Teſtament, and the circumſtances of that Ordinance, which are changed in the books of the New Teſtament, they are not changed by way of abrogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or diminution, but by way of accompliſhment and enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Covenant is inlarged from the ſtock of <hi>Abraham</hi> to all Nations; the ſeal of the Covenant, Circumciſion, is tranſlated to another more eaſie and acceptable; the time is inlarged in reſpect of the day; the Miniſter is inlarged in reſpect of his publike place; the ſubject is inlarged in reſpect of the ſex; and ſurely not diminiſhed, nor ſtraitned in reſpect of the age. It is therefore a needleſſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to plead, <q>That ſurely the New Teſtament, and the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Government, and Adminiſtration thereof, are no way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to the old Teſtament, where all things are directed by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe rule.</q>
               </p>
               <p>For a great part of the New Teſtament, or Covenant is expreſly delivered in the bookes of the Old Teſtament. <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſeth pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly, he taught nothing but what <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets did ſay ſhould come, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.22. And the greateſt part of the bookes of the Old Teſtament hold forth the Doctrine, Worſhip, Order and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the New Teſtament, to ſuch who have not a vaile laid over their hearts in the reading of the Old Teſtament, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.14. Let us therefore proceed to your other arguments, againſt the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of Infants, and conſider if there bee any greater weight on ſtrength in them.</p>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Silvanus.</note>Chriſt did not take it as ſuch an high contempt or injury offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to him by <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and the whole houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that the infants of his people, and of the Proſelytes that joyned to them, were received into Covenant with him, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the ſeale thereof; when as yet himſelfe was as ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall then as now he is. You doe herein apparently charge Chriſt himſelf with folly, and with indignity offered to himſelfe; that he ſhould ſo much forget himſelfe, that he being ſpirituall, ſhould take ſo many thouſand Infants into the Covenant with him, who for the moſt part are naturall, and (as you ſay) for one that is born of the Spirit, there were twenty born of the fleſh.</p>
               <p>But againe, let me tell you, that though Chriſt in taking a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to be a Church unto himſelfe, doth enter into marriage Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with them, both in the Old Teſtament, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.32. and in the New, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. yet not into a marriage Covenant with each member at firſt.

               <p>Furthermore, you ſhall doe well to obſerve, what Spirit breaths in ſuch a ſpeech, when you ſay, That ſuch a Church as receiveth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants <q>of beleeving parents into the fellowſhip of the Covenant, and ſeale thereof, that ſuch a Church is founded upon the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall birth.</q> For the Lord himſelfe ſpeaketh of ſuch a Church of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> as founded upon his Covenant, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.8.

               <p>But ſuppoſe that all the children in a Nation were baptized, yet that of it ſelf will not make a Nationall Church, but many Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in one Nation.</p>
               <p>Beſides, if one Family ſhould grow a Nation, as the houſe of <hi>Jacob</hi> did, and all the children being received into Covenant, and unto the ſeal thereof, the whole Nationall Generation ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come members of the Church, as they did in Iſrael: Yet that will <q>not bring the godly into bondage, and into ſcorn and contempt, nor put the power of Government to reſt in the hands of the wicked.</q>
               </p>
               <p>For the faithfulneſſe of God (who keepeth Covenant and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with his People) prevented that in the Houſe and Church of Iſrael. Where, though the whole Nation was in Covenant with God: yet ordinarily the Government was kept in the hands of ſuch, as either were Godly, or for the moſt part favoured godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Or, if they failed herein, God was wont to deliver both them and their Governours, into the hands of their Enemies, that they might learn to rule with God, and to bee faithfull with his Saints.</p>
               <p>But furthermore, this above all may juſtly ſatisfie you: That in the ſtate of the Churches of the New Teſtament, God hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted ſuch an order therein, that though all the Infants of the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:113833:89"/> Church-members bee baptized; yet none of them are received (by the order of the Goſpel) unto Communion at the Lords Table, nor unto liberty of power in the Government of the Church, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they doe approve themſelves both by publick Profeſſion before the Church, and alſo by their Chriſtian converſation, to take hold of the Covenant of their Fathers, and of the Church, and to walk in the ſteps of their Faith, and profeſſed ſubjection to the Goſpell of Chriſt. For it is an expreſſe Commandement given, as to all Chriſtians in their place, ſo eſpecially to the Officers and Brethren of the Church, Not to caſt holy things to dogges, nor Pearles before Swine, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.6. Nor to receive ſuch to the Lords Table, as have not on a Wedding Garment. But in ſuch a caſe the Servants and Miniſters of Chriſt, are to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>inde ſuch hand and foot, (to wit, by the cenſures of the Church,) and to caſt them out, unto outer darkneſſe, (<hi>Matth.</hi> 22.11, 12, 33.) that is to ſay, into ſuch an eſtate of darkneſſe, and miſery, wherein they live that are without. For without are Dogs, and Sorcerers, and Whore-mongers, and Murtherers, and Idolaters, and Lyars, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.15. And there want not holy, and judicious, and faithfull witneſſes of the Goſpel of Chriſt, and of the wayes of pure Reformation, who doe ſo expound the principles of the Apoſtles Catechiſme, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1.2. That none of the Members of the Church were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the fellowſhip of the Lords Table, but ſuch as were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned to Repentance, and had taſted of the Heavenly gift of Faith, and were partakers of the Holy Ghoſt (in ſome kinde) and had taſted the good Word of God, and the powers of the world to come, through the acknowledgement of the Reſurrection of the dead, and of the laſt judgement.</p>
               <p>Of theſe ſix Principles of the Apoſtles Catechiſme, the Lords Supper is not mentioned for one amongſt them, becauſe theſe chiefely concerned the baptized members of the Church, to bee trained up unto the knowledge (and taſte at leaſt) of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could bee admitted to the Lords Table. And if their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury profeſſion of theſe things were approved before the Church, then they were received (as confirmed Members) by laying on of hands. Which holy order was a long time preſerved pure in the purer ſort of Primitive Churches. But afterwards, it (as all other the Inſtitutions of Chriſt,) were abuſed and adulterated in the Papacy: this profeſſion and confirmation of baptized Infants, being tranſlated from the Church, whereof they were members, to
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:113833:89"/> the Biſhop; and their holy Profeſſion of the principall Doctrines and Duties of Chriſtianity, transformed into a Catechiſme touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Faith, and Promiſe of their God-fathers, and God-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: And the Impoſition of hands upon them by the Paſtour, or Biſhop, was finally transformed into a Sacrament. But all theſe groſſe ſuperſtitions, were but ſuper-additions to the firſt primitive holy inſtitution. And yet, as by the ſtraw and ſtubble, you may gather what kinde of Grain grew in the field: So by theſe abuſes of this Ordinance, it may eaſily bee gathered, what was the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of the Primitive Apoſtolick Churches in this caſe. Let then this primitive practiſe bee reſtored to its purity (as it is in ſome of the firſt Churches planted in this Countrey) and then there will bee no more feare of peſtering Churches with a carnall Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of members baptized in their Infancy, then of admitting a carnall company of Hypocrites, confeſſing their Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance in the face of the Congregation. Either the Lord in the faithfulneſſe of his Covenant, will ſanctifie the hearts of the baptized Infants to prepare them for his Table: or elſe hee will diſcover their hypocriſie and profaneneſſe in the preſence of his Church, before Men and Angels, and ſo prevent the pollution of the Lords Table, and corruption of the Diſcipline of the Church, by their partaking in them.</p>

                  <q>That it is a ground both of ignorance and errour, for it hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth people in blindneſſe, that they cannot come to know the nature of the holy Ordinance, nor what the ſame requireth in the ſubjects thereof, and alſo it cauſeth the ſimple to conceive, that Baptiſme is of neceſſity to ſalvation.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Doe you think that the Circumciſion of Infants in the dayes of the Old Teſtament, was any ground of ignorance or errour?<note place="margin">Silvanus.</note> that it held people in blindeneſſe, that they could not come to know the nature of that holy Ordinance, nor what the ſame requireth in the ſubjects thereof? Surely, God was of another minde, when hee ſaid, hee knew <hi>Abraham</hi> (who had lately circumciſed his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and houſehold) That hee would command his children and

In like ſort, the Baptiſme of a mans children, doth not allow him to keep them in blindnes and error, but rather bind and charge him to traine up his children in the knowledge, and faith, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt, into whoſe name they have been baptized. It is not the baptiſme of the children of believers, but of the children of carnall, and ignorant, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane perſons, that holdeth or keepeth men in the blindneſſe of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and error.</p>

               <p>

               </p>
               <p>But I pray you underſtand firſt, we never made baptiſme the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſtone of the Lords houſe, which is the peculiar prerogative of Chriſt himſelfe; Chriſt onely is the corner ſtone.</p>
               <p>Secondly, when we make (I meane acknowledge the Baptiſm of believers and of their ſeed, a true and precious ordinance of Chriſt, and one of the holy veſſels of his Church, wee doe not grant unto Antichriſt this authority, to lay this ſtone in his foundation; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe himſelf were firſt inveſted, with a lawfull calling to baptize; and unleſſe thoſe whom he did baptize were believers, and the ſeed of believers. Our baptizing of believers and their ſeed, do not grant him leave to baptize idolaters and their ſeed.</p>
               <p>If you ſay, but we take in ſuch to be members of our Church, who have been baptized in his Church (or at leaſt their fathers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them) and ſo take a ſtone out of the Temple of <hi>Babel,</hi> to lay in the foundation of <hi>Zion,</hi> contrary to the Word of the Lord, <hi>Jer.</hi> 51.26.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is another matter, but your words expreſſe no ſuch thing. Your words carry it, as if we granted him a chiefe corner ſtone of the Lords houſe to lye in his foundation; and not that he granteth us a ſtone out of his Babyloniſh Temple, to lye in the fóundation of the Lord houſe. But in very truth, neither doe we take a ſtone from him to lay in Gods houſe, by continuing the ſeale of the Covenant to believers and their ſeed, from <hi>Abrahams</hi> time to the Apoſtles time, and Baptiſme from the Apoſtles time till now. For the Baptiſme of believers and their ſeed is no more a ſtone that lyeth in the foundation of Antichriſt, then is the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt, (three perſons and one God) into whoſe name wee and our children are baptized. Though the people of God would not take a ſtone of <hi>Babel</hi> for a corner, or for a foundation of <hi>Zion,</hi> (according to <hi>Jer.</hi> 51.26.) yet they did not refuſe to take thoſe veſſels out of <hi>Babel,</hi> and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore them againe to the Lords Temple at <hi>Hieruſalem, Ezra</hi> 1.7, 8. with 6.5.

               </p>
               <p>I will not examine the termes of your Diſtinction of a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold paſſive ſubject (though I would not have you taken with it) which is indeed, neither Naturall, nor Artificiall, nor ſpirituall. For when you make the firſt ſort of a paſſive ſubject, a thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable, as is a ſtone: I might demand whether you mean unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable lawfully, or unlawfully. If you mean a ſtone is uncapable lawfully, ſo you conceive children to bee uncapable likewiſe, and all they upon whom Baptiſme is forced. And then the firſt part of your diſtinction, is all one with your ſecond part. And a good di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction cannot admit ſuch confuſion. If you mean a ſtone is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of Baptiſme unlawfully, you know the contrary. For the Papiſts doe baptize their Fonts and Altars (which are but ſtones) as well as their Bells, which are not more lawfully capable of Baptiſme then ſtones bee.</p>
               <p>Again, when you make your ſecond ſort of your paſſive ſubject <q>of Baptiſme, to bee a forced ſubject, and Infant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> to bee ſuch a forced ſubject, as who doe oppoſe it to the uttermoſt ability.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I dare bee bold to ſay, the ſpeech is not generally true. For of thoſe many hundreths which I have ſeen Baptized, though ſome have ſeemed to oppoſe it with crying and ſtrugling, yet I cannot ſay with truth, that either all of them, or moſt of them have ſo done. And for thoſe that have ſo done, I demand whether the Infants in times before Chriſt, when they were circumciſed, did not more generally, and ſtrongly oppoſe their Circumciſion to the uttermoſt of their ability, when they felt much more ſmarting pain in the cutting off of the foreskin of their fleſh, then our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren can doe in their Baptiſme?

                  </gap> well capable of Baptiſme? The Truth is, in adminiſtring either of Circumciſion to the Infants of beleeving Iſraelites, or of Baptiſme to the Infants of beleeving Chriſtian<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and voluntary ſubjection of their Parents. It is enough for Infants, that as they received ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall corruption without their own perſonall conſent, but in the will of their firſt Parents: ſo now they receive (through the grace of the Covenant) a remedy againſt their originall corruption with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their owne perſonall conſent, but in the will of their parent.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>But when you make the Infants oppoſition of his Baptiſme to his uttermoſt ability, a ſigne of its farre diſtance of being paſſive in the ſame.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The truth is by how much the more the Infant oppoſeth his baptiſme, by ſo much the more hee is active againſt it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being baptized nevertheleſſe, hee is ſo much the more paſſive under it. Your phraſe therefore of a paſſive ſubject of Baptiſme, is ill choſen to expreſſe your meaning, you might have more ſuitably ſaid in plainer termes, None are capable ſubjects of Baptiſme, but ſuch as gladly receive it. And for that you might have had ſome colour from the Word, but that the free and voluntary acts of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents in the matters of the ſecond commandement, are accounted of God for themſelves and their children, as was ſhewed above.</p>

But it is a grace and favour of Chriſt, that he encourageth parents to come to themſelves, and to bring their children in their Armes to him. And this grace is a bleſſing and favour to the children alſo ſo brought. For the children that were ſo brought to Chriſt, they returned home with a bleſſing, <hi>Mark.</hi> 10.16.</p>

               </p>
               <p>But when you ſay, Baptiſme is forced upon an Infant againſt his will. It is neither altogether true, not at all materiall. Not true, for it may be Infants doe as often cry, when they are carryed home from Baptiſme, as when they are brought forth to it.

               <p>A Ninth and laſt Argument againſt the Baptiſme of Infants is, that the doctrine thereof oppoſeth directly the expreſſe <q>word of God, by teaching that Infants are in the Covenant of grace being borne of beleeving parents, and ſo an holy ſeed, by vertue of which they have right to Baptiſme as a Priviledge of Grace, againſt which the Holy Ghoſt affirmes, that all are conceived in ſinne, brought forth in iniquity, and ſo by nature the children of wrath and under curſe, and except they bee borne againe from above, they cannot ſee the Kingdome of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.5. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10.13, 14. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.3.5, 6. <hi>Joh</hi> 1.12, 13.

               <p n="1">1. There bee ſome that will deny that which you call the Major, though indeed it be not the Major of that Syllogiſme, which your ſelfe propound; For that Major was this, If the Covenant of Grace bee abſolute and ſtable, then all within the ſame muſt bee ſaved. But I will not ſtick with you upon termes, though they bee your owne. If you call it a Major, let it goe for a Major: But this which you call a Major, there bee ſome who will deny it, and tell you, that all the ſeed of beleevers without exception are not in the Covenant of Grace, but the Elect ſeed onely. They will grant you, that <hi>Iſmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> and all ſuch Apoſtates, as doe fall off from the Covenant, and grace offered to them, they were never under the Covenant of grace, but of works onely. And yet as all the children of the faithfull, were circumciſed then (<hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael</hi> as well as <hi>Iſaac, Eſau</hi> as well as <hi>Jacob</hi>) ſo ought they to bee baptized now. In this caſe they conceive the Apoſtles words ſtretch ſo farre, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.29. As it was then, ſo is it now.</p>
               <p>But 2. Others will anſwer you another way, that though the Covenant of grace bee ſtable, yet it is not abſolute: ſtable to the faithfull ſeed, but not abſolute, but requiring the Condition
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:113833:97"/> of faith, which condition alſo God will worke in the elect ſeede. And therefore though <hi>Iſmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> were not ſaved, yet it is no impeachment to the ſtability of the Covenant, becauſe the Covenant is onely ſtable to the faithfull ſeed, which theſe were not.</p>
               <p>A third Anſwer ſomewhat like to this, and yet different, may be this, That though the Covenant of Grace be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> abſolute, and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet it will not follow, that all within that Covenant muſt bee ſaved, for the Covenant though it bee abſolute and ſtable to all the elect ſeed, yet not to all the ſeed, becauſe all of them are not Elect, to whom onely the Grace of Chriſt is abſolute and ſtable. And yet ſuch as are not elect may bee truely ſaid to bee under this Covenant. For wee doe not reade in Scripture of any Covenant which is everlaſting, but onely the Covenant of Grace, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40. And yet you read of a wicked generation, that have broken this everlaſting Covenant, <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 24.5. which argueth they were under the bond of it, or elſe how could they bee blamed (as there they bee) and curſed, for the breach of it? They therefore who were not Elected but accurſed, were under this Covenant, and yet they making it void unto themſelves, it is evident it was not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and ſtable to them. The unbeleeving Jews (of whom the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.) who were broken off from Chriſt (as branches from the fat Olive tree) they had beene in ſome ſenſe in Chriſt, or elſe how could they bee ſaid to bee broken off from him? And if they were in him, and not by faith, then were they in him ſome other way, and yet not by Election: therefore onely by Adoption, or admiſſion into the Covenant of their Fathers, which was a Covenant of Grace.</p>

But becauſe you would pick an argument, from a true doctrine of God, to gather an evill conſequence, that ſo God ſhould bee an Author to make a man beleeve, that which he himſelf knoweth and revealeth the contrary: I conceive it to tend to the glory of God to obſerve, that your ſelf in laying downe this Argument doe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe your ſelfe contrary to that which you know to bee your meaning: and doe affirme God to know that, which you know
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:113833:98"/> is contrary to his knowledge. For you expreſly make it an untruth and contrary to what God himſelfe knoweth and revealeth to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve the ſalvation (I doe not ſay of <hi>Iſmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> for it is an untruth indeed to beleeve their ſalvation) but to beleeve the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a remnant among the Jews, nay of none at all, but ſuch as doe beleeve. Truely if God had not blinded you for offering to argue God to be an Author of an untruth, upon the ſuppoſition of the Baptiſme of infants (which is an holy truth of God) you would never have delivered ſo palpable an untruth contrary to <q>your owne knowledge, as to ſay, this is an untruth contrary to what God himſelf knoweth and reveales, to beleeve the ſalvation of a remnant among the Jews,</q> nay of none at all but ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve.

The other Scriptures which you doe alledge to prove your propoſition (that the Covenant of Grace is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and ſtable unto all once within the ſame) they none of them ſpeake to your purpoſe. The Text in <hi>Iſay</hi> 49.21. ſpeaketh that the Church ſhall wonder at the increaſe of her children, after ſhee had loſt the other, and ſhall therefore enquire, who had begotten theſe to her. But what maketh this to prove that the Covenant of Grace is abſolute and ſtable to all thoſe who are once within the ſame? It rather proveth that ſome of the children of the Church, and ſo ſome within the Covenant of the Church have beene loſt, and that is contrary to your propoſition.</p>
               <p>Your next place in <hi>Ierem.</hi> 31.3. holdeth forth that God loved the houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> with an everlaſting love; and the text in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13.1. declareth that whom Chriſt loveth hee loveth to the end: And that in <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.6. teacheth us that the Lord Jehovah is unchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and therefore that the ſonnes of <hi>Iacob</hi> periſh not.

The former they have received from Chriſt by a double Act of his.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He hath furniſhed many of them with Miniſteriall gifts.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

Thus when Pirates have invaded a ſhip, no man in it (neither Officer nor Paſſenger) can come by his owne goods, but by leave of the Pirates; who upon their ſubmiſſion to them, will give them the keyes of their owne veſſels and cheſts. This power (to come to their owne goods) received from the Pirates, is not that which giveth them true and proper right to enter upon the poſſeſſion and uſe of their owne goods (for that right they had by a former juſt title,) which Pirates cannot diſanull, but it is onely adventitious and accidentall.

And this Argument taken from the Powerfull preſence of God with a Miniſtery to confirme the lawfull authority of it, though it now meete with exceptions, &amp; cavils from the ſonnes of men: yet God himſelf judgeth it to bee of that weight, and convincing power, as to ſtop the mouths even of gainſaying Rebels, and quiete to take away al murmurings againſt it, and againſt him in it. The ſtory is well known, when the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſome of the tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> had often murmured againſt <hi>Aaron</hi> and his ſonnes for executing the Prieſts Office; the Lord commanded <hi>Moſes</hi> to take twelve Rods from the fathers of the twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and to lay them up, and <hi>Aarons</hi> rod amongſt them, before the Lord in the Tabernacle: to the intent that the Lord might ſhew by his bleſſing upon any of the Rods, which of all the Tribes himſelfe had choſen to miniſter before him. And in the morning when the Rods were taken forth, the Rod of <hi>Aaron</hi> had budded, and brought forth buds and bloomed bloſſoms, and yeelded Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, <hi>Num.</hi> 17.5. to 10. which was an effectuall demonſtration of the divine approbation of <hi>Aarons</hi> Miniſtery. And if this be ſuch an effectuall demonſtration of a miniſters calling to be of god, that the Lord bleſſeth the Rod of his Miniſtery with fruitfull increaſe; then let all the murmurings of Gods people againſt the truth of the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Godly Miniſters in <hi>England</hi> ceaſe for ever.</p>
               <p>Harlots are ſometimes bleſſed of God with fruitfull increaſe as well as chaſt wives.<note place="margin">Silveſter.</note> And therefore though Miniſters and Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches may bee bleſſed with Converſion and Regeneration of ſoules unto God, yet it is no evident Demonſtration of the truth, either of ſuch Miniſters or ſuch Churches.</p>

For it is not ſaid, that the Apoſtles carryed them away from thence to any poole, or river, where they might bee drenched. In <hi>Philips</hi> bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of Eunuch, it is ſaid, they went down both together into the water, to wit, both <hi>Philip,</hi> and the Eunuch, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.38. But their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downe into the water was not part of the Baptiſme: For <hi>Philip</hi> went downe into the water, as well as the Eunuch. And it was no part of <hi>Philips</hi> meanning to baptize himſelfe. Beſides, the words tranſlated they went downe, expreſſeth no more but that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended out of the Chariot into the water: but how deep is not at all mentioned.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, It is a conſideration of weight with mee, that though the perſon baptized bee ſaid to deſcend into the water, yet the baptizing lay not in the deſcending, or dipping of the body in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the water, but in the ſprinkling, or pouring the water upon the body. For in dipping wee apply the body to the water: In ſprinkling, or pouring the water, the water is applied to the body: which doth more lively ſet forth the grace of Chriſt in the waſhing away of our ſinnes; which is done, rather by applying Chriſts blood to us, then by applying our ſelves to the blood of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Moreover when you ſtand ſo much for dipping, I demand, and I pray you anſwer to mee, (or to your ſelfe ingenuouſly) Whether would you have the whole body dipped or part onely? If the whole body, whether naked, or clothed? If clothed, then outward bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme is not a waſhing of the fleſh, but of the cloaths rather; If na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, how will it ſtand with civility or modeſty to Baptize men and women of grown yeares, (for children you admit none) in the face of the whole Congregation? No marvell then, if the Sect of the Adamites grow out of your Sect. But if you require but part of the body to bee baptized, I demand what part?

And in very truth, the whole virtue and efficacy of the death of Chriſt is as well, and as fully applyed in the Act of ſprinkling, as of dipping.

<pb n="191" facs="tcp:113833:104"/> hee foretold, that Chriſt ſhould ſprinkle many Nations, <hi>Eſay,</hi> 52.15. And when the Apoſtle exhorteth us to draw neer unto God in full aſſurance of faith (in reſpect of the perfect Oblation of Chriſt for us once for all, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22.) hee expreſſeth our drawing neare as having our hearts ſprinkled from an evill conſcience, and our bodies waſhed with pure water, The faithfull people of God are not wont to value the virtue of the gifts of Chriſt, from the bulke of outward ſignes, but from the lively virtue and power of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of life conveyed in them.

               <p>Firſt, That the Church of <hi>England</hi> doth not adminiſter Baptiſm for this end, to work Regeneration.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That though it ſhould aime at ſuch an end, yet that would not make the Baptiſme falſe.</p>
               <p>For the fitſt, The Church of <hi>England</hi> doth profeſſedly teach the contrary Doctrine, not onely in their Pulpits, but in Bookes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by publique authority, That the Sacraments doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get Faith, nor Regeneration, <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> but they are ſignes and ſeales of both. Neither do the publique prayers of the Church hold forth their judgement otherwiſe. But as in judgement they doe beleeve, that God by Covenant promiſeth to poure clean wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon us, and upon our ſeed, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.3. and that he ſealeth the Covenant and promiſe by Baptiſme: So before Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme they pray him to accompliſh this Promiſe according to his Covenant, which God is about to confirme by that ſeale. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Baptiſme they taking Gods Word and Seale as a Pledge and aſſurance of the thing already done, which will indeed in due time bee done according to the true intent and meaning of Gods Word and Seale, (that is, to the elect ſeed abſolutely, to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall ſeed ſufficiently to leave them without excuſe in the offer of the meanes) they therefore give him thankes for it, as done alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. When <hi>Iſrael</hi> heard their redemption out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and ſaw the ſignes which <hi>Moſes</hi> wrought for the confirmation of it, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved

               <p>For the Second, Though the Church of <hi>England</hi> had ſuch a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and falſe end in their Baptiſme (which they have not) as to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter the ſame for the working of Regeneration: yet that would not make it a falſe Baptiſme. The Nature and vertue of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth not depend upon the intention of the Miniſter. The Iewiſh Teachers in the time of Chriſt, and of his Apoſtles had a corrupt and falſe end in Adminiſtring Circumciſion, to wit, as neceſſary to Iuſtification and Salvation, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. yet that miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleife or unbeleife of man did not evacuate the Faith of God, nor the truth of his Ordinance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.3.

                     </gap> whom the reſt doe commonly, but falſely call Anabaptiſts) then the Baptiſme of beleevers would utterly be abandoned out of the world.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Silvanus.</note>Our anſwer is ready in two or three words.</p>
               <p>Firſt, If Infants themſelves bee beleevers (as ſome of them be, or elſe all of them be damned, <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.16.) then in baptizing all the Infants of the faithfull, the Baptiſme of ſome beleevers is continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If all the people of <hi>England</hi> bee baptized, and many of them bee beleevers, then ſuppoſing (as hath beene proved) the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme of the ſeed of beleevers to bee lawfull, there is no beleever in <hi>England,</hi> nor in any ſuch like Church in the world, that is left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If a beleever bee not in Gods account baptized himſelfe, till his ſeed bee baptized alſo, (as hath been ſhewed above) then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon the Baptiſme of the ſeed of beleevers (two wit, the Baptiſme of Infants) out of the world, and abandon the baptiſme of beleevers out of the world, neither is there any conpetent, reaſon, that ſhould exclude Infants (the ſeed of beleevers) from being capable and competent ſubjects of baptiſme, as well as their beleeving Parents.</p>
               <p>For firſt, They are conſoederates with God (partakers of his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant) as well as their parents. I will bee (ſaith God) a God unto thee, and to thy ſeed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They are Diſciples of Chriſt, Holy, Freeborne, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the Kingdome of God, as hath beene opened above.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, There is no Impediment in them to the Grace offered in Baptiſme, but what by Grace they are capable of the removall thereof.</p>
               <p>For firſt, Their a verſion from God is Habituall, not actuall: and therefore the pouring forth of the habit of Grace into them may remove it, which the Holy Ghoſt is wont to doe in the waſhing of Regeneration, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5, 6.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Their ſin was by the fall of their firſt parents, therefore their reſtoring may bee by the faith of their next parents. God is wont to obſerve ſuch a proportion, in Captivity, and Redemption; Yee ſold your ſelves for nought, and ye ſhall bee redeemed without money, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In a word therefore, If by all this conference, (that wee have had together) it may appeare, that the Infants of beleevers are true and capable Subjects of Baptiſme; then ſuch as having beene baptized in their Infancy, ſhall afterwards receive another Baptiſme, they are as well juſtly as commonly called Anabaptiſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Secondly The former leaving of your judgement againſt the Baptiſme of, your ſeed, is ſuch a killing ſinne to the life of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant (as much as in you lyeth) that till you doe unfeignedly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of it, the Lord may juſtly leave you to ſtraitneſſe of heart, and unbeleife in the promiſe for your childe.</p>
